INT. HORNE RESIDENCE - NIGHT

In the HORNE residence wing of the Great Northern Hotel, the HORNE family sits quietly around the dinner table. BENJAMIN HORNE and SYLVIA HORNE sit at opposite ends of a long dinner table while AUDREY HORNE and JOHNNY HORNE, wearing an Indian headdress, sit opposite each other near the middle of the table. Except for JOHNNY making a few odd sounds, the room is filled with the sounds of tableware clanking as the family eats. Until the door burst open and JERRY HORNE, BENJAMIN'S younger, wiry brother, walks in. JERRY looks back out at the hall.

JERRY,"Brother Ben, this is the best damn sandwich I ever ate, it's a baguette, with brie and butter, I had four of these damn things every day I was there. You gotta try this. (hands a sandwich to BEN) Here, go ahead, eat it, go ahead, go ahead.

Very interested, BENJAMIN takes the sandwich and draws his nose over it to smell it deeply.",1
BENJAMIN,"Oh, yeah.

BENJAMIN really likes the smell of the sandwich. Grabbing the long ends of the sandwich, he takes a large bite out of it. With his mouth full he hums in ecstasy. JERRY unwraps himself one and sits nearby at the fireplace. JERRY'S mouth is soon full from a bite of his sandwich and is laughing at BEN'S reaction.",1
BENJAMIN,"(with his mouth full) Uhm, this is incredible, Jerr.

JERRY continues to laugh with his mouth full as BENJAMIN madly takes another big bite out of his own sandwich. SYLVIA is annoyed by their actions. BENJAMIN and JERRY talk to each other with their mouths full.",1
BENJAMIN,You know what this reminds us of.,1
JERRY,Mmm.,1
BENJAMIN,(barely intelligible) Remember when we were kids.,1
JERRY,Mm.,1
BENJAMIN,It reminds us of Jeanne and Jenny down by the river. Do you remember? Hmm.,1
JERRY,"My god, your right.",1
BENJAMIN,"Am I right, am I right. Hmm.",1
JERRY,"(laughs) Oh, no wonder.",1
BENJAMIN,"Hmm, hmm. (laughs)

They now both laugh and hum with satisfaction from their sandwiches. BENJAMIN motions to JERRY to follow him.",1
BENJAMIN,"Jerr, outside, outside.

BENJAMIN HORNE wipes his mouth, puts his napkin on the table, rises, smiles and looks around at his family.",1
BENJAMIN,"Always a pleasure.

The rest of the HORNE family continue to eat silently at the table as BEN and JERRY leave the room. They both leave carrying their sandwiches and close the door to the dining room. SYLVIA has both of her hands to her bowed head in frustration.

She slowly puts a finger to the side of her nose and then slowly lowers her hand, almost pointing at him as it drops. As the LITTLE MAN rubs his hands, a shadow of a bird passes in the background behind the red drapes.

Both the LITTLE MAN'S and the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN'S speech is oddly stilted but COOPER'S speech is normal. We see subtitles under them, with the correct words. The LITTLE MAN stops rubbing his hands, opens his eyes, turns to COOPER and says ...",1

NORMA walks off to fetch her coffee. AUDREY turns to look at DONNA who is staring at her with a bit of a scowl. DR. HAYWARD is once again eating his pie and speaks to EILEEN.

DR. HAYWARD
Remind me to stop at the hardware store and get those sixty watt bulbs.

NORMA places an empty cup in front of AUDREY and fills it from a pot of coffee. NORMA looks her over, AUDREY appears preoccupied.",2
AUDREY,"Thanks.

NORMA nods and walks off. AUDREY takes a sip of her coffee, places it back down and wipes the lipstick from where she drank it. Once again, she turns to look at DONNA. DONNA is still looking at her but without the scowl.",2

DONNA walks over to AUDREY and sits beside her.",2

DONNA,"So my parents said they saw you at church today, I didn't see you.",2
AUDREY,"Yeah, I came by because of Laura.",2
DONNA,What do you mean? I didn't even think you liked her.,2
AUDREY,"There were things about Laura I didn't like, but she did help take care of my brother Johnny. Guess I sort of loved her for that.

AUDREY runs her finger around the rim of her coffee cup, staring into the cup.",2
AUDREY,Do you like coffee?,2
DONNA,"Yeah, with cream and sugar.",2
AUDREY,Agent Cooper loves coffee.,2
DONNA,"(smiles) Audrey.

AUDREY,(looks away) Nothing.,2
DONNA,"No, what do you mean.",2
AUDREY,"He used to sing to her. (looks over to the jukebox) God I love this music. (turns to DONNA) Isn't it too dreamy.

AUDREY gets up from her seat, walks over to an open area of the floor near the jukebox and starts to seductively sway to the sound of the music. EILEEN sees her dance and gestures to DR. HAYWARD to take a look. From her seat, DONNA looks oddly at her as she moves to the music.

Two of the easy chairs are close together. Beside them are two tall Saturn lamps. A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN who looks exactly like LAURA PALMER sits across from COOPER in one of those chairs.

COPPER stares at the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN and she stares back at him. He turns to look at the LITTLE MAN. The LITTLE MAN stops shaking, turns to COOPER and claps his hands once.",2

COOPER looks at the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, who is still staring at him and smiles enigmatically. She slowly puts a finger to the side of her nose and then slowly lowers her hand, almost pointing at him as it drops. As the LITTLE MAN rubs his hands, a shadow of a bird passes in the background behind the red drapes.

Both the LITTLE MAN'S and the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN'S speech is oddly stilted but COOPER'S speech is normal. We see subtitles under them, with the correct words. The LITTLE MAN stops rubbing his hands, opens his eyes, turns to COOPER and says ...",2
LITTLE MAN,"I've got good news! That gum you like is going to ... come back in style.

In 1950, Communist China invaded Tibet and while leaving the Dalai Lama nominally in charge, they in fact seized control of the entire country.

SHERIFF TRUMAN,I hear that you're real good at what you do.,3
ALBERT,"Yeah, that's correct.",3
SHERIFF TRUMAN,"Well that's good, because normally if a stranger walked into my station talking this kind of crap, he'd be looking for his teeth two blocks up on queer street.

ALBERT and SHERIFF TRUMAN look eye-to-eye. ALBERT blinks first, puts on his shades, and heads out. His men follow. LUCY enjoyed the confrontation and smiles as they leave. SHERIFF TRUMAN looks at COOPER, who, with a smile, gives him a thumbs up.

We lived above it. I mean it like it is, like it sounds. I too have been touched by the devilish one. Tattoo on the left shoulder ... oh, but when I saw the face of god, I was changed.

Next to it is a coffee table with a model of Saturn. A LITTLE MAN, three and a half feet tall, in a red suit, stands with his back to COOPER, shaking violently. Two of the easy chairs are close together. Beside them are two tall Saturn lamps. A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN who looks exactly like LAURA PALMER sits across from COOPER in one of those chairs.

COPPER stares at the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN and she stares back at him. He turns to look at the LITTLE MAN. The LITTLE MAN stops shaking, turns to COOPER and claps his hands once.",3
LITTLE MAN,"Let's rock!

The LITTLE MAN moves over and sits in a chair beside the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. The LITTLE MAN closes his eyes and rubs his hands slowly together, a ringing sound is produced.

SOUND EFFECT: SPIRIT PRESENCE RINGING   20K

COOPER looks at the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, who is still staring at him and smiles enigmatically. She slowly puts a finger to the side of her nose and then slowly lowers her hand, almost pointing at him as it drops. As the LITTLE MAN rubs his hands, a shadow of a bird passes in the background behind the red drapes.

Both the LITTLE MAN'S and the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN'S speech is oddly stilted but COOPER'S speech is normal. We see subtitles under them, with the correct words. The LITTLE MAN stops rubbing his hands, opens his eyes, turns to COOPER and says ...",3
LITTLE MAN,"I've got good news! That gum you like is going to ... come back in style.

COOPER sits quietly listening to him and turns to the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. The LITTLE MAN turns to look at the WOMAN and then back to COOPER.",3
LITTLE MAN,"She's my cousin, ... but doesn't she look ... almost exactly like Laura Palmer?",3
COOPER,But it is Laura Palmer. Are you Laura Palmer?,3

Strange saxophone music filters into the air. The LITTLE MAN hops off the chair and begins to dance a strange dance. A light, like a strobelight, flashes on and off. The BEAUTIFUL WOMAN rises, goes over, and gently kisses COOPER on the mouth. She then softly whispers something in his ear.

WILL HAYWARD stand near the table arguing. DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN is standing behind DR. HAYWARD and watches the two argue.

DR. HAYWARD
Your the most cold-blooded man I've ever seen. I've never in my life met a man with so little regard for human frailty. Have you no compassion?

ALBERT moves nearly face to face with DR. HAYWARD and points a surgical tool onto his chest.",4
ALBERT,"Oh, I've got compassion running out of my nose pal. I'm the sultan of sentiment. Dr. Hayward, I have traveled thousands of miles and apparently several centuries to this forgotten sink hole, in order to perform a series of test. Now I do not ask you to understand these test, I'm not a cruel man. I just ask you to get the hell out of my way so that I can finish my work, is that clear!

DR. HAYWARD
Where here to conduct Laura Palmer's body to the cemetery. If you think that for one minute we're going to leave here without her (grabs ALBERT'S jacket) your out of your mind!

ALBERT and DR. HAYWARD grab and jerk each other around in anger. BENJAMIN runs up between them and separates them. ANDY pulls DR. HAYWARD back.",4
BENJAMIN,"Alright, alright, alright. Alright. Alright! Mr. Rosenfield, please. (takes off his glasses and composes himself) Now, uh, Leland Palmer couldn't be with us today but I know I speak for everyone, the Palmer family included. When I say that uh ... we appreciate and understand the value of your work but as their representative I ... I must insist that we consider the feelings of the Palmer family as well. (puts his glasses back on)",4
ALBERT,"Mr. Horne, I realize that your position in this fair community pretty well ... guarantees a venality and sincerity and uh ... a rather irritating method of expressing yourself. Stupidity however, (taps his surgical tool to BEN'S arm, it annoys him) is not a necessarily inherent trait. Therefore, please listen closely. You can have a funeral any ol' time. You dig a hole, you plant a coffin. I however can not perform these test next year, (slams a tool in his hand to the table) next month, next week or tomorrow. I must perform them now. (puts goggles over his eyes, grabs a high speed pneumatic drill and triggers it on and off to test it) I've got a lot of cutting and pasting to do gentlemen so please why don't you return to your porch rockers and resume whittling.

ALBERT turns on the drill and moves over to LAURA'S head where he intends to work.

DR. HAYWARD
That does it. (he pulls the pneumatic air supply cable out of the pumping machinery) I'm taking charge of the body and you don't touch Laura from this moment on.",4
ALBERT,"The hell you ...

ALBERT takes his goggles off, slams them to the ground, rushes over to DR. HAYWARD and grabs at his jacket. They once again yell and jerk each other around. SHERIFF TRUMAN and COOPER pull a room divider curtain aside and see the two struggling.",4
COOPER,Gentlemen!,4
SHERIFF TRUMAN,What's going on!,4
ALBERT,"Thank god.

ALBERT walks over to COOPER, on the other side of the table, grabs him by the arm and pulls him over to DR. HAYWARD.",4
ALBERT,"Cooper, this old fool is obstructing a criminal investigation. Cuff him.

DR. HAYWARD
He won't release Laura's body for the funeral. He's not human.

SHERIFF TRUMAN stands next to DR. HAYWARD.",4
SHERIFF TRUMAN,What's the holdup?,4
ALBERT,"Please Cooper, I do not suffer fools gladly and fools with badges never. I want no interference from this hulking boob, is that clear.",4
SHERIFF TRUMAN,I've had just about enough of your insults.,4
ALBERT,"Oh yeah, well I've had about enough of morons and half wits, dolts, dunces, dullards and dumbbells ... and you chowder head yokel, you blithering hayseed. You-you-you've had enough of me?",4
SHERIFF TRUMAN,"Yes I have.

SHERIFF TRUMAN winds up and hits ALBERT across the jaw that sends him spinning and landing face to face on top of the body of LAURA PALMER. ALBERT turns his head to face him and feels his sore jaw.",4
ALBERT,"Oh that's nice. How appropriate.

SHERIFF TRUMAN moves towards ALBERT but COOPER stops him.",4
COOPER,"Wait in the car Harry.

ALBERT slowly gets himself off the table and SHERIFF TRUMAN leaves the room.",4
ALBERT,"Thee ol' rustic sucker punch, huh. A hail of bullets would be nice!",4
COOPER,That's enough! The sheriff didn't mean anything.,4
ALBERT,He hit me.,4
COOPER,"Well I'm sure he meant to do that. Albert, I want you to release this girl's body to her family immediately. I want your test results by noon. Those are orders.

ALBERT walks out of the room.

MAJOR GARLAND BRIGGS, in his usual Air Force uniform, enters the room from the side.",4
MAJOR BRIGGS,"Robert. (surprised, BOBBY turns to him) This may be a good time for a brief discussion.",4
BOBBY,"You want to talk about cigarettes, today!",4
MAJOR BRIGGS,"No, but put it out. Its a filthy habit especially for a varsity athlete.

BOBBY takes one last drag, turns to the table and extinguishes his cigarette in a ash tray. He then takes a seat at the table. His father follows suit next to him.",4
MAJOR BRIGGS,"I have attended my share of funerals, too many. Anytime a man dies in war, he dies too soon. (places his hand on BOBBY'S shoulder, it annoys him) Laura died too soon as well.",4
BOBBY,"Yeah, she did.",4
MAJOR BRIGGS,"But we have a responsibility to the dead, Robert. Responsibility is the linch pin of our society. Each man responsible for his own actions. Each action contributing to the greater good.

BOBBY starts to play with his cigarette lighter; opening it, lighting it and closing it.",4
BOBBY,"What's the good of putting someone in the ground.

BOBBY lights the cigarette lighter and places it on the table. As his father speaks, BOBBY waves his hand over the flame.",4
MAJOR BRIGGS,"Its man's way of achieving closure. The ceremony begins understanding and the will to carry on without those we must leave behind. Robert, in your life you must learn, you will learn, to carry on without them.",4
BOBBY,Great.,4
MAJOR BRIGGS,"I realize you experience an ongoing disinclination to enter a meaningful exchange. This leads to stalemate ... the desire on my part to pour certain wisdom upon you. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, sometimes its the best course available. Son don't be afraid. We'll all be there together.

BOBBY closes his lighter.",4
BOBBY,Afraid of what?,4
MAJOR BRIGGS,Well the funeral.,4
BOBBY,"I'm not afraid of any damn funeral. Afraid? I can hardly wait. AFRAID! I'M GOING TO TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN!

Together they enter the conference room where ALBERT is seated at the table.",4

ALBERT,"Enough forensic spade work to save your butt and get mine out of this god forsaking burg.

COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN sit together opposite ALBERT. Next to ALBERT is a television monitor and video cassette player along with a folder filled with the materials he has collected in his investigation of LAURA'S body.",4
SHERIFF TRUMAN,"What ya' got?

ALBERT gives him a smirk.",4
ALBERT,"Okay, first of all, contents of envelope found in Palmer diary, cocaine. (throws a small packet to the table for them to inspect) Toxicology results also positive. News flash, the little lady had a habit. Next we got fibers of twine in bedded in her wrists and upper arms. (throws another small packet to the table for them to inspect) Two different kinds of twine. Fibers of twine found at railroad car match the sample from her wrists. The same twine was used to bind the wrists of the Pulaski girl. Conclusion, she was tied up twice and at different locations on the night of her death. Once here (points to his wrists) and once here (points to his upper arms) like this (places both arms behind his back).

COOPER is astonished as he remembers a line from the beautiful woman in his dream.",4
COOPER,Sometimes my arms bend back.,4
ALBERT,"Here we got traces of pumice found in standing water outside the railroad car. (throws a small packet to the table for them to inspect) Soap industrial strength. I found identical particles in the back of Laura's neck. Its not her home use brand. My conclusion, the killer washed his hands and then leaned in for a kiss like this.

ALBERT acts out his description by showing how the hand would be under her neck to support it.",4
SHERIFF TRUMAN,"Good lord.

ALBERT plays a video tape. The tape shows a closeup of scratches on LAURA'S body that he points out.",4
ALBERT,Distinctive wounds found on Laura's neck and shoulder appear to be ... claw marks. Bites of some kind.,4
SHERIFF TRUMAN,An animal?,4
ALBERT,"(smiles and points at TRUMAN; smartass) Look its trying to think.

COOPER doesn't react to his smartass remark. ALBERT shuts the monitor off.",4
ALBERT,Finally a small plastic fragment from her stomach partially dissolved by digestive acids. (throws a small packet with the item for them to inspect) I'm taking it back to the lab for reconstruction as the local facilities give new meaning to the word primitive. I note with some interest what appears to be the letter 'J'.,4
COOPER,Good work Albert.,4
ALBERT,"Couple more days with the body who know's what else I might have found.

DEPUTY ANDY peers through the open door of the conference room.",4
ANDY,"Sheriff, its time.",4
SHERIFF TRUMAN,"Excuse us. We ... have got a funeral to get to.

SHERIFF TRUMAN leaves the room. COOPER also gets up to leave.",4
ALBERT,"Cooper, may I have a word with you alone?

COOPER stops short of the door and closes it for privacy.",4
ALBERT,"There's one more item. Its a report concerning the physical assault on my person which you witnessed this morning. I think you find that's its quite accurate. Requires your signature.

ALBERT hands him the document and COOPER scans it over.",4
COOPER,"Albert, I'm not going to sign this.",4
ALBERT,What?,4
COOPER,"Albert, I hope you can hear me. I've only been in Twin Peaks a short time but in that time I have seen decency, honor and dignity. Murder is not a faceless event here. It is not a statistic to be tallied up at the end of the day. Laura Palmer's death has affected each and every man, woman and child because life has meaning here, every life. That a way of living I thought had vanished from the Earth but it hasn't Albert its right here in Twin Peaks.",4
ALBERT,Sounds like you've been snacking on some of the local mushrooms.,4
COOPER,"With your behavior towards these good people, consider yourself lucky I do not file a report of my own that could bury you in the building so deep in Washington you'd never see the sun.

ALBERT, disgruntled, collects his paperwork and leaves the room, closing the door behind himself. COOPER, alone in the conference room, takes his tape recorder out of his pocket and looks at his watch.",4
COOPER,"Diane, its 12:27 pm. I'd like you to look into my pension plan options regarding outside real estate investment. I may look into purchasing a piece of property at what I assume will be a very reasonable price.

Through the same, thy son, Jesus Christ our lord who live'th and reign'th with thee and the holy spirit. One god now and forever, amen. I baptized Laura Palmer. I instructed her in Sunday school and I, like the rest of you, came to love her with that special love that we reserve for thee headstrong and the bold. Laura was bright, she was beautiful, she was charming but most of all Laura was, I think, impatient. She was impatient for her life to begin. For the world to finally catch up to her dreams and ambitions. Laura used to say that I talked to much. I'll not make that mistake today.

DR. HAYWARD
Your the most cold-blooded man I've ever seen. I've never in my life met a man with so little regard for human frailty. Have you no compassion?

ALBERT moves nearly face to face with DR. HAYWARD and points a surgical tool onto his chest.",5
ALBERT,"Oh, I've got compassion running out of my nose pal. I'm the sultan of sentiment. Dr. Hayward, I have traveled thousands of miles and apparently several centuries to this forgotten sink hole, in order to perform a series of test. Now I do not ask you to understand these test, I'm not a cruel man. I just ask you to get the hell out of my way so that I can finish my work, is that clear!

DR. HAYWARD
Where here to conduct Laura Palmer's body to the cemetery. If you think that for one minute we're going to leave here without her (grabs ALBERT'S jacket) your out of your mind!

ALBERT and DR. HAYWARD grab and jerk each other around in anger. BENJAMIN runs up between them and separates them. ANDY pulls DR. HAYWARD back.",5
BENJAMIN,"Alright, alright, alright. Alright. Alright! Mr. Rosenfield, please. (takes off his glasses and composes himself) Now, uh, Leland Palmer couldn't be with us today but I know I speak for everyone, the Palmer family included. When I say that uh ... we appreciate and understand the value of your work but as their representative I ... I must insist that we consider the feelings of the Palmer family as well. (puts his glasses back on)",5
ALBERT,"Mr. Horne, I realize that your position in this fair community pretty well ... guarantees a venality and sincerity and uh ... a rather irritating method of expressing yourself. Stupidity however, (taps his surgical tool to BEN'S arm, it annoys him) is not a necessarily inherent trait. Therefore, please listen closely. You can have a funeral any ol' time. You dig a hole, you plant a coffin. I however can not perform these test next year, (slams a tool in his hand to the table) next month, next week or tomorrow. I must perform them now. (puts goggles over his eyes, grabs a high speed pneumatic drill and triggers it on and off to test it) I've got a lot of cutting and pasting to do gentlemen so please why don't you return to your porch rockers and resume whittling.

ALBERT turns on the drill and moves over to LAURA'S head where he intends to work.

DR. HAYWARD
That does it. (he pulls the pneumatic air supply cable out of the pumping machinery) I'm taking charge of the body and you don't touch Laura from this moment on.",5
ALBERT,"The hell you ...

ALBERT takes his goggles off, slams them to the ground, rushes over to DR. HAYWARD and grabs at his jacket. They once again yell and jerk each other around. SHERIFF TRUMAN and COOPER pull a room divider curtain aside and see the two struggling.",5
COOPER,Gentlemen!,5
SHERIFF TRUMAN,What's going on!,5
ALBERT,"Thank god.

ALBERT walks over to COOPER, on the other side of the table, grabs him by the arm and pulls him over to DR. HAYWARD.",5
ALBERT,"Cooper, this old fool is obstructing a criminal investigation. Cuff him.

DR. HAYWARD
He won't release Laura's body for the funeral. He's not human.

SHERIFF TRUMAN stands next to DR. HAYWARD.",5
SHERIFF TRUMAN,What's the holdup?,5
ALBERT,"Please Cooper, I do not suffer fools gladly and fools with badges never. I want no interference from this hulking boob, is that clear.",5
SHERIFF TRUMAN,I've had just about enough of your insults.,5
ALBERT,"Oh yeah, well I've had about enough of morons and half wits, dolts, dunces, dullards and dumbbells ... and you chowder head yokel, you blithering hayseed. You-you-you've had enough of me?",5
SHERIFF TRUMAN,"Yes I have.

SHERIFF TRUMAN winds up and hits ALBERT across the jaw that sends him spinning and landing face to face on top of the body of LAURA PALMER. ALBERT turns his head to face him and feels his sore jaw.",5
ALBERT,"Oh that's nice. How appropriate.

SHERIFF TRUMAN moves towards ALBERT but COOPER stops him.",5
COOPER,"Wait in the car Harry.

ALBERT slowly gets himself off the table and SHERIFF TRUMAN leaves the room.",5
ALBERT,"Thee ol' rustic sucker punch, huh. A hail of bullets would be nice!",5
COOPER,That's enough! The sheriff didn't mean anything.,5
ALBERT,He hit me.,5
COOPER,"Well I'm sure he meant to do that. Albert, I want you to release this girl's body to her family immediately. I want your test results by noon. Those are orders.

(throws another small packet to the table for them to inspect) Two different kinds of twine. Fibers of twine found at railroad car match the sample from her wrists. The same twine was used to bind the wrists of the Pulaski girl. Conclusion, she was tied up twice and at different locations on the night of her death. Once here (points to his wrists) and once here (points to his upper arms) like this (places both arms behind his back).

COOPER is astonished as he remembers a line from the beautiful woman in his dream.",5
COOPER,Sometimes my arms bend back.,5
ALBERT,"Here we got traces of pumice found in standing water outside the railroad car. (throws a small packet to the table for them to inspect) Soap industrial strength. I found identical particles in the back of Laura's neck. Its not her home use brand. My conclusion, the killer washed his hands and then leaned in for a kiss like this.

ALBERT acts out his description by showing how the hand would be under her neck to support it.",5
SHERIFF TRUMAN,"Good lord.

ALBERT plays a video tape. The tape shows a closeup of scratches on LAURA'S body that he points out.",5
ALBERT,Distinctive wounds found on Laura's neck and shoulder appear to be ... claw marks. Bites of some kind.,5
SHERIFF TRUMAN,An animal?,5
ALBERT,"(smiles and points at TRUMAN; smartass) Look its trying to think.

COOPER doesn't react to his smartass remark. ALBERT shuts the monitor off.",5
ALBERT,Finally a small plastic fragment from her stomach partially dissolved by digestive acids. (throws a small packet with the item for them to inspect) I'm taking it back to the lab for reconstruction as the local facilities give new meaning to the word primitive. I note with some interest what appears to be the letter 'J'.,5

COOPER stops short of the door and closes it for privacy.",5
ALBERT,"There's one more item. Its a report concerning the physical assault on my person which you witnessed this morning. I think you find that's its quite accurate. Requires your signature.

ALBERT hands him the document and COOPER scans it over.",5
COOPER,"Albert, I'm not going to sign this.",5
ALBERT,What?,5
COOPER,"Albert, I hope you can hear me. I've only been in Twin Peaks a short time but in that time I have seen decency, honor and dignity. Murder is not a faceless event here. It is not a statistic to be tallied up at the end of the day. Laura Palmer's death has affected each and every man, woman and child because life has meaning here, every life. That a way of living I thought had vanished from the Earth but it hasn't Albert its right here in Twin Peaks.",5
ALBERT,Sounds like you've been snacking on some of the local mushrooms.,5
COOPER,"With your behavior towards these good people, consider yourself lucky I do not file a report of my own that could bury you in the building so deep in Washington you'd never see the sun.

ALBERT, disgruntled, collects his paperwork and leaves the room, closing the door behind himself. COOPER, alone in the conference room, takes his tape recorder out of his pocket and looks at his watch.",5
COOPER,"Diane, its 12:27 pm. I'd like you to look into my pension plan options regarding outside real estate investment. I may look into purchasing a piece of property at what I assume will be a very reasonable price.

Blessed be the dead who die of the lord. Even so say'th the spirit. For they rest from their labors. The lord be with thee. Let us pray. Oh god entrust this child, Laura, to thy never failing care and love and bring us all to thy heavenly kingdom. Through the same, thy son, Jesus Christ our lord who live'th and reign'th with thee and the holy spirit. One god now and forever, amen. I baptized Laura Palmer. I instructed her in Sunday school and I, like the rest of you, came to love her with that special love that we reserve for thee headstrong and the bold. Laura was bright, she was beautiful, she was charming but most of all Laura was, I think, impatient. She was impatient for her life to begin. For the world to finally catch up to her dreams and ambitions. Laura used to say that I talked to much. I'll not make that mistake today.

In the replay of dream, the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN gently kisses COOPER on the mouth and then whispers something in his ear.",6
COOPER,"The beautiful woman. She's filled with secrets, sometimes her arms bend back, where she's from the birds sing a pretty song and there's always music in the air. The midget did a dance, Laura kissed me and she whispered the name of the killer in my ear.

On the other side of the table, in the background, BENJAMIN HORNE is looking down at her. We are in an examination room of the hospital in the morgue. AGENT ALBERT ROSENFIELD and DR. WILL HAYWARD stand near the table arguing. DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN is standing behind DR. HAYWARD and watches the two argue.

DR. HAYWARD
Your the most cold-blooded man I've ever seen. I've never in my life met a man with so little regard for human frailty. Have you no compassion?

ALBERT moves nearly face to face with DR. HAYWARD and points a surgical tool onto his chest.",6
ALBERT,"Oh, I've got compassion running out of my nose pal. I'm the sultan of sentiment. Dr. Hayward, I have traveled thousands of miles and apparently several centuries to this forgotten sink hole, in order to perform a series of test. Now I do not ask you to understand these test, I'm not a cruel man. I just ask you to get the hell out of my way so that I can finish my work, is that clear!

DR. HAYWARD
Where here to conduct Laura Palmer's body to the cemetery. If you think that for one minute we're going to leave here without her (grabs ALBERT'S jacket) your out of your mind!

ALBERT and DR. HAYWARD grab and jerk each other around in anger. BENJAMIN runs up between them and separates them. ANDY pulls DR. HAYWARD back.",6
BENJAMIN,"Alright, alright, alright. Alright. Alright! Mr. Rosenfield, please. (takes off his glasses and composes himself) Now, uh, Leland Palmer couldn't be with us today but I know I speak for everyone, the Palmer family included. When I say that uh ... we appreciate and understand the value of your work but as their representative I ... I must insist that we consider the feelings of the Palmer family as well. (puts his glasses back on)",6
ALBERT,"Mr. Horne, I realize that your position in this fair community pretty well ... guarantees a venality and sincerity and uh ... a rather irritating method of expressing yourself. Stupidity however, (taps his surgical tool to BEN'S arm, it annoys him) is not a necessarily inherent trait. Therefore, please listen closely. You can have a funeral any ol' time. You dig a hole, you plant a coffin. I however can not perform these test next year, (slams a tool in his hand to the table) next month, next week or tomorrow. I must perform them now. (puts goggles over his eyes, grabs a high speed pneumatic drill and triggers it on and off to test it) I've got a lot of cutting and pasting to do gentlemen so please why don't you return to your porch rockers and resume whittling.

ALBERT turns on the drill and moves over to LAURA'S head where he intends to work.

DR. HAYWARD
That does it. (he pulls the pneumatic air supply cable out of the pumping machinery) I'm taking charge of the body and you don't touch Laura from this moment on.",6
ALBERT,"The hell you ...

ALBERT takes his goggles off, slams them to the ground, rushes over to DR. HAYWARD and grabs at his jacket. They once again yell and jerk each other around. SHERIFF TRUMAN and COOPER pull a room divider curtain aside and see the two struggling.",6
COOPER,Gentlemen!,6
SHERIFF TRUMAN,What's going on!,6
ALBERT,"Thank god.

ALBERT walks over to COOPER, on the other side of the table, grabs him by the arm and pulls him over to DR. HAYWARD.",6
ALBERT,"Cooper, this old fool is obstructing a criminal investigation. Cuff him.

DR. HAYWARD
He won't release Laura's body for the funeral. He's not human.

SHERIFF TRUMAN stands next to DR. HAYWARD.",6
SHERIFF TRUMAN,What's the holdup?,6
ALBERT,"Please Cooper, I do not suffer fools gladly and fools with badges never. I want no interference from this hulking boob, is that clear.",6
SHERIFF TRUMAN,I've had just about enough of your insults.,6
ALBERT,"Oh yeah, well I've had about enough of morons and half wits, dolts, dunces, dullards and dumbbells ... and you chowder head yokel, you blithering hayseed. You-you-you've had enough of me?",6
SHERIFF TRUMAN,"Yes I have.

SHERIFF TRUMAN winds up and hits ALBERT across the jaw that sends him spinning and landing face to face on top of the body of LAURA PALMER. ALBERT turns his head to face him and feels his sore jaw.",6
ALBERT,"Oh that's nice. How appropriate.

SHERIFF TRUMAN moves towards ALBERT but COOPER stops him.",6
COOPER,"Wait in the car Harry.

ALBERT slowly gets himself off the table and SHERIFF TRUMAN leaves the room.",6
ALBERT,"Thee ol' rustic sucker punch, huh. A hail of bullets would be nice!",6
COOPER,That's enough! The sheriff didn't mean anything.,6
ALBERT,He hit me.,6
COOPER,"Well I'm sure he meant to do that. Albert, I want you to release this girl's body to her family immediately. I want your test results by noon. Those are orders.

ALBERT walks out of the room.

DR. HAYWARD
Thank you, Agent Cooper.

News flash, the little lady had a habit. Next we got fibers of twine in bedded in her wrists and upper arms. (throws another small packet to the table for them to inspect) Two different kinds of twine. Fibers of twine found at railroad car match the sample from her wrists. The same twine was used to bind the wrists of the Pulaski girl. Conclusion, she was tied up twice and at different locations on the night of her death.

ALBERT hands him the document and COOPER scans it over.",6
COOPER,"Albert, I'm not going to sign this.",6
ALBERT,What?,6
COOPER,"Albert, I hope you can hear me. I've only been in Twin Peaks a short time but in that time I have seen decency, honor and dignity. Murder is not a faceless event here. It is not a statistic to be tallied up at the end of the day. Laura Palmer's death has affected each and every man, woman and child because life has meaning here, every life. That a way of living I thought had vanished from the Earth but it hasn't Albert its right here in Twin Peaks.",6
ALBERT,Sounds like you've been snacking on some of the local mushrooms.,6
COOPER,"With your behavior towards these good people, consider yourself lucky I do not file a report of my own that could bury you in the building so deep in Washington you'd never see the sun.

ALBERT, disgruntled, collects his paperwork and leaves the room, closing the door behind himself. COOPER, alone in the conference room, takes his tape recorder out of his pocket and looks at his watch.",6

As REVEREND CLARENCE BROCKLEHURST gives his sermon, we view several different faces in the crowd starting with COOPER, DONNA HAYWARD, BOBBY and BIG ED. Next as the sermon continues we view COOPER follow BOBBY'S eyes to JAMES who has just arrived. BOBBY scornfully looks at JAMES. DONNA and JAMES look at each other. PETE has tears in his eyes as he looks at the casket. AUDREY and COOPER look at each other and smile.",6
REVEREND CLARENCE,"I am the resurrection and the life. He that believe'th in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. And who shall ever live'th and believe'th in me shall never die. For none of us live'th to himself and no man die'th to himself. For if we live, we live unto the lord and if we die, we die to the lord. Whether we live therefore or we die, we are the lords. Blessed be the dead who die of the lord. Even so say'th the spirit. For they rest from their labors. The lord be with thee. Let us pray. Oh god entrust this child, Laura, to thy never failing care and love and bring us all to thy heavenly kingdom. Through the same, thy son, Jesus Christ our lord who live'th and reign'th with thee and the holy spirit. One god now and forever, amen. I baptized Laura Palmer. I instructed her in Sunday school and I, like the rest of you, came to love her with that special love that we reserve for thee headstrong and the bold. Laura was bright, she was beautiful, she was charming but most of all Laura was, I think, impatient. She was impatient for her life to begin. For the world to finally catch up to her dreams and ambitions. Laura used to say that I talked to much. I'll not make that mistake today. Just let it be said that I loved her and I will miss her the rest of my days.",6

All you good people, you wanna know who killed Laura. YOU DID! We all did and pretty words aren't going to bring her back man so save your prayers. She would've laughed at them anyway.

From the other side of the crowd, behind the crowd, JAMES rushes over to confront BOBBY. BOBBY sees him and reciprocates. MIKE NELSON also runs over. We view the action as COOPER, SHERIFF TRUMAN, DEPUTY HAWK, MAJOR BRIGGS and BIG ED rush to catch, and stop them from fighting.",6

The casket, being held above the bottom of the grave by straps connected to a motor, starts to move down. The mechanical system is overwhelmed by the extra weight and generates a screeching metal sound as it fails.",6
LELAND,"Oh my baby, Laura.

LELAND hugs the casket as it slowly moves down into the grave but the mechanical system kicks in again. It starts to raise the casket out of the grave but fails again and the casket goes down again. Again and again the mechanical system tries to lift the casket and fails producing the sound of screeching metal each time. SHERIFF TRUMAN and COOPER try to grab LELAND.",6

DALE COOPER, twenty-five years older, sits in one of the chairs. A light, like a strobelight, flashes on and off. A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN who looks exactly like LAURA PALMER, slowly moves over to COOPER.",7
COOPER,"There was a midget in a red suit and a beautiful woman. The little man told me that my favorite gum was coming back into style and didn't his cousin look exactly like Laura Palmer, which she did.",7
SHERIFF TRUMAN,"What cousin?

In the replay of dream, the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN gently kisses COOPER on the mouth and then whispers something in his ear.",7
COOPER,"The beautiful woman. She's filled with secrets, sometimes her arms bend back, where she's from the birds sing a pretty song and there's always music in the air. The midget did a dance, Laura kissed me and she whispered the name of the killer in my ear.

On the other side of the table, in the background, BENJAMIN HORNE is looking down at her. We are in an examination room of the hospital in the morgue. AGENT ALBERT ROSENFIELD and DR. WILL HAYWARD stand near the table arguing. DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN is standing behind DR. HAYWARD and watches the two argue.

DR. HAYWARD
Your the most cold-blooded man I've ever seen. I've never in my life met a man with so little regard for human frailty. Have you no compassion?

ALBERT moves nearly face to face with DR. HAYWARD and points a surgical tool onto his chest.",7
ALBERT,"Oh, I've got compassion running out of my nose pal. I'm the sultan of sentiment. Dr. Hayward, I have traveled thousands of miles and apparently several centuries to this forgotten sink hole, in order to perform a series of test. Now I do not ask you to understand these test, I'm not a cruel man. I just ask you to get the hell out of my way so that I can finish my work, is that clear!

DR. HAYWARD
Where here to conduct Laura Palmer's body to the cemetery. If you think that for one minute we're going to leave here without her (grabs ALBERT'S jacket) your out of your mind!

ALBERT and DR. HAYWARD grab and jerk each other around in anger. BENJAMIN runs up between them and separates them. ANDY pulls DR. HAYWARD back.",7
BENJAMIN,"Alright, alright, alright. Alright. Alright! Mr. Rosenfield, please. (takes off his glasses and composes himself) Now, uh, Leland Palmer couldn't be with us today but I know I speak for everyone, the Palmer family included. When I say that uh ... we appreciate and understand the value of your work but as their representative I ... I must insist that we consider the feelings of the Palmer family as well. (puts his glasses back on)",7
ALBERT,"Mr. Horne, I realize that your position in this fair community pretty well ... guarantees a venality and sincerity and uh ... a rather irritating method of expressing yourself. Stupidity however, (taps his surgical tool to BEN'S arm, it annoys him) is not a necessarily inherent trait. Therefore, please listen closely. You can have a funeral any ol' time. You dig a hole, you plant a coffin. I however can not perform these test next year, (slams a tool in his hand to the table) next month, next week or tomorrow. I must perform them now. (puts goggles over his eyes, grabs a high speed pneumatic drill and triggers it on and off to test it) I've got a lot of cutting and pasting to do gentlemen so please why don't you return to your porch rockers and resume whittling.

ALBERT turns on the drill and moves over to LAURA'S head where he intends to work.

DR. HAYWARD
That does it. (he pulls the pneumatic air supply cable out of the pumping machinery) I'm taking charge of the body and you don't touch Laura from this moment on.",7
ALBERT,"The hell you ...

ALBERT takes his goggles off, slams them to the ground, rushes over to DR. HAYWARD and grabs at his jacket. They once again yell and jerk each other around. SHERIFF TRUMAN and COOPER pull a room divider curtain aside and see the two struggling.",7
COOPER,Gentlemen!,7
SHERIFF TRUMAN,What's going on!,7
ALBERT,"Thank god.

ALBERT walks over to COOPER, on the other side of the table, grabs him by the arm and pulls him over to DR. HAYWARD.",7
ALBERT,"Cooper, this old fool is obstructing a criminal investigation. Cuff him.

DR. HAYWARD
He won't release Laura's body for the funeral. He's not human.

SHERIFF TRUMAN stands next to DR. HAYWARD.",7
SHERIFF TRUMAN,What's the holdup?,7
ALBERT,"Please Cooper, I do not suffer fools gladly and fools with badges never. I want no interference from this hulking boob, is that clear.",7
SHERIFF TRUMAN,I've had just about enough of your insults.,7
ALBERT,"Oh yeah, well I've had about enough of morons and half wits, dolts, dunces, dullards and dumbbells ... and you chowder head yokel, you blithering hayseed. You-you-you've had enough of me?",7
SHERIFF TRUMAN,"Yes I have.

SHERIFF TRUMAN winds up and hits ALBERT across the jaw that sends him spinning and landing face to face on top of the body of LAURA PALMER. ALBERT turns his head to face him and feels his sore jaw.",7
ALBERT,"Oh that's nice. How appropriate.

SHERIFF TRUMAN moves towards ALBERT but COOPER stops him.",7
COOPER,"Wait in the car Harry.

ALBERT slowly gets himself off the table and SHERIFF TRUMAN leaves the room.",7
ALBERT,"Thee ol' rustic sucker punch, huh. A hail of bullets would be nice!",7
COOPER,That's enough! The sheriff didn't mean anything.,7
ALBERT,He hit me.,7
COOPER,"Well I'm sure he meant to do that. Albert, I want you to release this girl's body to her family immediately. I want your test results by noon. Those are orders.

ALBERT walks out of the room.

DR. HAYWARD
Thank you, Agent Cooper.

ALBERT,"Okay, first of all, contents of envelope found in Palmer diary, cocaine. (throws a small packet to the table for them to inspect) Toxicology results also positive. News flash, the little lady had a habit. Next we got fibers of twine in bedded in her wrists and upper arms. (throws another small packet to the table for them to inspect) Two different kinds of twine. Fibers of twine found at railroad car match the sample from her wrists. The same twine was used to bind the wrists of the Pulaski girl. Conclusion, she was tied up twice and at different locations on the night of her death. Once here (points to his wrists) and once here (points to his upper arms) like this (places both arms behind his back).

COOPER is astonished as he remembers a line from the beautiful woman in his dream.",7

I found identical particles in the back of Laura's neck. Its not her home use brand. My conclusion, the killer washed his hands and then leaned in for a kiss like this.

ALBERT acts out his description by showing how the hand would be under her neck to support it.",7

ALBERT hands him the document and COOPER scans it over.",7
COOPER,"Albert, I'm not going to sign this.",7
ALBERT,What?,7
COOPER,"Albert, I hope you can hear me. I've only been in Twin Peaks a short time but in that time I have seen decency, honor and dignity. Murder is not a faceless event here. It is not a statistic to be tallied up at the end of the day. Laura Palmer's death has affected each and every man, woman and child because life has meaning here, every life. That a way of living I thought had vanished from the Earth but it hasn't Albert its right here in Twin Peaks.",7
ALBERT,Sounds like you've been snacking on some of the local mushrooms.,7
COOPER,"With your behavior towards these good people, consider yourself lucky I do not file a report of my own that could bury you in the building so deep in Washington you'd never see the sun.

ALBERT, disgruntled, collects his paperwork and leaves the room, closing the door behind himself. COOPER, alone in the conference room, takes his tape recorder out of his pocket and looks at his watch.",7

I instructed her in Sunday school and I, like the rest of you, came to love her with that special love that we reserve for thee headstrong and the bold. Laura was bright, she was beautiful, she was charming but most of all Laura was, I think, impatient. She was impatient for her life to begin.

She finishes by raising and lowering the napkin dispenser with her 'small man' on top. SHELLY also provides the sound effects of crying and of the broken machinery. The two customers laugh at it all.

DR. HAYWARD
Your the most cold-blooded man I've ever seen. I've never in my life met a man with so little regard for human frailty. Have you no compassion?

ALBERT moves nearly face to face with DR. HAYWARD and points a surgical tool onto his chest.",8
ALBERT,"Oh, I've got compassion running out of my nose pal. I'm the sultan of sentiment. Dr. Hayward, I have traveled thousands of miles and apparently several centuries to this forgotten sink hole, in order to perform a series of test. Now I do not ask you to understand these test, I'm not a cruel man. I just ask you to get the hell out of my way so that I can finish my work, is that clear!

DR. HAYWARD
Where here to conduct Laura Palmer's body to the cemetery. If you think that for one minute we're going to leave here without her (grabs ALBERT'S jacket) your out of your mind!

BENJAMIN,"Alright, alright, alright. Alright. Alright! Mr. Rosenfield, please. (takes off his glasses and composes himself) Now, uh, Leland Palmer couldn't be with us today but I know I speak for everyone, the Palmer family included. When I say that uh ... we appreciate and understand the value of your work but as their representative I ... I must insist that we consider the feelings of the Palmer family as well. (puts his glasses back on)",8
ALBERT,"Mr. Horne, I realize that your position in this fair community pretty well ... guarantees a venality and sincerity and uh ... a rather irritating method of expressing yourself. Stupidity however, (taps his surgical tool to BEN'S arm, it annoys him) is not a necessarily inherent trait. Therefore, please listen closely. You can have a funeral any ol' time. You dig a hole, you plant a coffin. I however can not perform these test next year, (slams a tool in his hand to the table) next month, next week or tomorrow. I must perform them now. (puts goggles over his eyes, grabs a high speed pneumatic drill and triggers it on and off to test it) I've got a lot of cutting and pasting to do gentlemen so please why don't you return to your porch rockers and resume whittling.

ALBERT turns on the drill and moves over to LAURA'S head where he intends to work.

DR. HAYWARD
That does it. (he pulls the pneumatic air supply cable out of the pumping machinery) I'm taking charge of the body and you don't touch Laura from this moment on.",8

ALBERT,"Oh yeah, well I've had about enough of morons and half wits, dolts, dunces, dullards and dumbbells ... and you chowder head yokel, you blithering hayseed. You-you-you've had enough of me?",8
SHERIFF TRUMAN,"Yes I have.

SHERIFF TRUMAN winds up and hits ALBERT across the jaw that sends him spinning and landing face to face on top of the body of LAURA PALMER. ALBERT turns his head to face him and feels his sore jaw.",8
ALBERT,"Oh that's nice. How appropriate.

SHERIFF TRUMAN moves towards ALBERT but COOPER stops him.",8

BOBBY takes one last drag, turns to the table and extinguishes his cigarette in a ash tray. He then takes a seat at the table. His father follows suit next to him.",8
MAJOR BRIGGS,"I have attended my share of funerals, too many. Anytime a man dies in war, he dies too soon. (places his hand on BOBBY'S shoulder, it annoys him) Laura died too soon as well.",8
BOBBY,"Yeah, she did.",8

BOBBY starts to play with his cigarette lighter; opening it, lighting it and closing it.",8

BOBBY lights the cigarette lighter and places it on the table. As his father speaks, BOBBY waves his hand over the flame.",8

SHERIFF TRUMAN,"What ya' got?

ALBERT gives him a smirk.",8
ALBERT,"Okay, first of all, contents of envelope found in Palmer diary, cocaine. (throws a small packet to the table for them to inspect) Toxicology results also positive. News flash, the little lady had a habit. Next we got fibers of twine in bedded in her wrists and upper arms. (throws another small packet to the table for them to inspect) Two different kinds of twine. Fibers of twine found at railroad car match the sample from her wrists. The same twine was used to bind the wrists of the Pulaski girl. Conclusion, she was tied up twice and at different locations on the night of her death. Once here (points to his wrists) and once here (points to his upper arms) like this (places both arms behind his back).

COOPER is astonished as he remembers a line from the beautiful woman in his dream.",8
COOPER,Sometimes my arms bend back.,8
ALBERT,"Here we got traces of pumice found in standing water outside the railroad car. (throws a small packet to the table for them to inspect) Soap industrial strength. I found identical particles in the back of Laura's neck. Its not her home use brand. My conclusion, the killer washed his hands and then leaned in for a kiss like this.

ALBERT acts out his description by showing how the hand would be under her neck to support it.",8
SHERIFF TRUMAN,"Good lord.

ALBERT plays a video tape. The tape shows a closeup of scratches on LAURA'S body that he points out.",8

COOPER doesn't react to his smartass remark. ALBERT shuts the monitor off.",8
ALBERT,Finally a small plastic fragment from her stomach partially dissolved by digestive acids.

COOPER stops short of the door and closes it for privacy.",8
ALBERT,"There's one more item. Its a report concerning the physical assault on my person which you witnessed this morning. I think you find that's its quite accurate. Requires your signature.

ALBERT hands him the document and COOPER scans it over.",8
COOPER,"Albert, I'm not going to sign this.",8
ALBERT,What?,8
COOPER,"Albert, I hope you can hear me. I've only been in Twin Peaks a short time but in that time I have seen decency, honor and dignity. Murder is not a faceless event here. It is not a statistic to be tallied up at the end of the day. Laura Palmer's death has affected each and every man, woman and child because life has meaning here, every life. That a way of living I thought had vanished from the Earth but it hasn't Albert its right here in Twin Peaks.",8
ALBERT,Sounds like you've been snacking on some of the local mushrooms.,8
COOPER,"With your behavior towards these good people, consider yourself lucky I do not file a report of my own that could bury you in the building so deep in Washington you'd never see the sun.

ALBERT, disgruntled, collects his paperwork and leaves the room, closing the door behind himself. COOPER, alone in the conference room, takes his tape recorder out of his pocket and looks at his watch.",8

I instructed her in Sunday school and I, like the rest of you, came to love her with that special love that we reserve for thee headstrong and the bold. Laura was bright, she was beautiful, she was charming but most of all Laura was, I think, impatient. She was impatient for her life to begin.
