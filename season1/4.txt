FADE IN:

INT. LOG LADY'S CABIN - DAY

Seated at a dining table beside a tea set we see a woman, 'LOG LADY' MARGARET LANTERMEN. In her arms she carries a wooden log. She is speaking to us.

LOG LADY
There is a sadness in this world, for we are ignorant of many things. Yes, we are ignorant of many beautiful things ... things like the truth. So sadness, in our ignorance, is very real. The tears are real. What is this thing called a tear? There are even tiny ducts, tear ducts, to produce these tears should the sadness occur. Then the day when the sadness comes ... then we ask. Will this sadness which makes me cry ... will this sadness that makes my heart cry out, will it ever end? The answer, of course, is yes. One day the sadness will end.

INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAY

TUNE: FRESHLY SQUEEZED (0:26 - 3:48)

AUDREY HORNE, wearing a red dress, lays against a wood pole in the lobby. In the background, FBI SPECIAL AGENT DALE COOPER is moving up a hallway toward the lobby. He is talking into his tape recorder.

COOPER
Diane, 7:15 am, I'll be heading to the sheriff's after breakfast. Then we'll be going on to Laura Palmer's funeral.

AUDREY peers around the pole to look at him. With a smile, she turns back and walks off.




CUT TO:

INT. TIMBER ROOM - DAY

We view a large carved wooden fish hanging above the fireplace wall in the dining area. We PAN down to see AUDREY standing and waiting for COOPER, who comes up to her. She salutes him and says ...

AUDREY
Good morning Colonel Cooper.

COOPER
Just agentAudrey, Special Agent.

AUDREY
Special Agent. (smiles)

COOPER
Would you care to join me for breakfast.

AUDREY
I'm in a hurry.

COOPER
For what?

He walks toward an open table then suddenly turns to her and says ...

COOPER
Audrey, that perfume your wearing is incredible.

AUDREY
Do you really think so?

COOPER
Yes I do. Please have a seat. And would you write your name down for me. Here. (he gives her a pen and a napkin)

AUDREY
Okay.

AUDREY writes her name down on a napkin and COOPER watches. From his pocket, he removes the note that was slipped under his door and compares the handwriting to AUDREY'S signature as she writes it.

COOPER
Audrey, there's something you'd like to tell me.

AUDREY
There is?

COOPER
You slipped this note underneath my door the night before last.

AUDREY
(coyly) I did? (realizes the game is up) I wanted to help you, for Laura.

COOPER
You said you and Laura weren't exactly friends.

AUDREY
We weren't friends but I understood her better then the rest.

COOPER
What is One-Eye Jacks?

AUDREY
Its a place up North. Men go there.

COOPER
What about women?

AUDREY
(slightly embarrassed) Uh, women ... you know, work there.

COOPER
Did Laura work there?

AUDREY
I don't know. Laura worked at my father's department store.

COOPER
Horne's.

AUDREY
(nods) He named it after himself.

COOPER
Where at Horne's Department Store?

AUDREY
At the perfume counter.

COOPER
(realization) So did Ronette Pulaski.

AUDREY
Really?

COOPER
Audrey, that rightward slant in your handwriting indicates a romantic nature. A heart that yearns, be careful.

AUDREY
(smile) I do?

From behind AUDREY, COOPER sees SHERIFF HARRY S. TRUMAN and LUCY MORAN enter the dining area.

COOPER
I'm going to have to ask you to leave now. Police business.

AUDREY
Thank you for talking to me.

AUDREY leaves. TRUDY, a waitress, comes by to take COOPER'S order as SHERIFF TRUMAN and LUCY reach the table and take a seat.

TUNE ENDS: FRESHLY SQUEEZED (0:26 - 3:48)

COOPER
Trudy, two more coffees please. Harry, Lucy, it is an absolutely beautiful morning. (to TRUDY) Shortstack of griddle cakes, melted butter, maple syrup lightly heated, slice of ham. Nothing beats the taste sensation when maple syrup (slaps his hands) collides with ham.

TRUDY
Griddle cakes, slice of ham.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Who killed Laura Palmer?

COOPER
(sips his coffee) Ahhh. Harry, let me tell you about the dream I had last night.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Tibet?

COOPER
No. You were there, Lucy so were you. Harry my dream is a code waiting to be broken. Break the code solve the crime.

LUCY
(taking notes; repeats) Break the code ... solve the ... crime.

SHERIFF TRUMAN looks at what LUCY is writing as she repeats the line. She is a little embarrassed by it after she notices that she was being watched.

COOPER
In my dream, Sarah Palmer has a vision of her daughter's killer. Deputy Hawk sketched his picture. I got a phone call from a one-armed man, named Mike. The killer's name was Bob.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Mike and Bobby?

COOPER
No, its different Mike and a different Bob. They lived above a convenience store. They had a tattoo, fire walk with me. Mike couldn't stand the killing any more so he cut off his arm. Bob vowed to kill again so Mike shot him. Do you know where dreams come from?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Not specifically. (he and LUCY nod no)

COOPER
Acetylcholine Neurons fire high voltage impulses into the forebrain. These impulses become pictures, the pictures become dreams but ... no one knows why we choose these particular pictures.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Well, what was the end of this dream?

COOPER
Suddenly it was twenty five years later. I was old sitting in a red room.

TUNE: DANCE OF THE DREAM MAN

INT. WAITING ROOM

We review the last portion from COOPER'S dream as we hear his voice describing the dream. A large, windowless, well-lit, sparsely furnished, red-draped room with a table and three easy chairs. DALE COOPER, twenty-five years older, sits in one of the chairs. A light, like a strobelight, flashes on and off. A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN who looks exactly like LAURA PALMER, slowly moves over to COOPER.

COOPER
There was a midget in a red suit and a beautiful woman. The little man told me that my favorite gum was coming back into style and didn't his cousin look exactly like Laura Palmer, which she did.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What cousin?

In the replay of dream, the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN gently kisses COOPER on the mouth and then whispers something in his ear.

COOPER
The beautiful woman. She's filled with secrets, sometimes her arms bend back, where she's from the birds sing a pretty song and there's always music in the air. The midget did a dance, Laura kissed me and she whispered the name of the killer in my ear.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Who was it?

COOPER
(takes a sip of coffee) Ahh, I don't remember.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Damn.

LUCY
Damn.

COOPER
Harry, our job is simple. Break the code, solve the crime.

SHERIFF TRUMAN'S police radio buzzes for an incoming call, he answers it.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yeah. (reply over the radio) You hang on I'll be right there. That was Andy, there's a fight over at the morgue.

COOPER
(nods) Albert.

COOPER'S breakfast had just arrived and he scans it over knowing he won't be able to enjoy it because he has to leave.




CUT TO:

INT. CALHOUN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - DAY

We view a CLOSEUP of LAURA PALMER'S face. We ZOOM OUT to view that LAURA PALMER'S body is on an examining table covered with a sheet. On the other side of the table, in the background, BENJAMIN HORNE is looking down at her. We are in an examination room of the hospital in the morgue. AGENT ALBERT ROSENFIELD and DR. WILL HAYWARD stand near the table arguing. DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN is standing behind DR. HAYWARD and watches the two argue.

DR. HAYWARD
Your the most cold-blooded man I've ever seen. I've never in my life met a man with so little regard for human frailty. Have you no compassion?

ALBERT moves nearly face to face with DR. HAYWARD and points a surgical tool onto his chest.

ALBERT
Oh, I've got compassion running out of my nose pal. I'm the sultan of sentiment. Dr. Hayward, I have traveled thousands of miles and apparently several centuries to this forgotten sink hole, in order to perform a series of test. Now I do not ask you to understand these test, I'm not a cruel man. I just ask you to get the hell out of my way so that I can finish my work, is that clear!

DR. HAYWARD
Where here to conduct Laura Palmer's body to the cemetery. If you think that for one minute we're going to leave here without her (grabs ALBERT'S jacket) your out of your mind!

ALBERT and DR. HAYWARD grab and jerk each other around in anger. BENJAMIN runs up between them and separates them. ANDY pulls DR. HAYWARD back.

BENJAMIN
Alright, alright, alright. Alright. Alright! Mr. Rosenfield, please. (takes off his glasses and composes himself) Now, uh, Leland Palmer couldn't be with us today but I know I speak for everyone, the Palmer family included. When I say that uh ... we appreciate and understand the value of your work but as their representative I ... I must insist that we consider the feelings of the Palmer family as well. (puts his glasses back on)

ALBERT
Mr. Horne, I realize that your position in this fair community pretty well ... guarantees a venality and sincerity and uh ... a rather irritating method of expressing yourself. Stupidity however, (taps his surgical tool to BEN'S arm, it annoys him) is not a necessarily inherent trait. Therefore, please listen closely. You can have a funeral any ol' time. You dig a hole, you plant a coffin. I however can not perform these test next year, (slams a tool in his hand to the table) next month, next week or tomorrow. I must perform them now. (puts goggles over his eyes, grabs a high speed pneumatic drill and triggers it on and off to test it) I've got a lot of cutting and pasting to do gentlemen so please why don't you return to your porch rockers and resume whittling.

ALBERT turns on the drill and moves over to LAURA'S head where he intends to work.

DR. HAYWARD
That does it. (he pulls the pneumatic air supply cable out of the pumping machinery) I'm taking charge of the body and you don't touch Laura from this moment on.

ALBERT
The hell you ...

ALBERT takes his goggles off, slams them to the ground, rushes over to DR. HAYWARD and grabs at his jacket. They once again yell and jerk each other around. SHERIFF TRUMAN and COOPER pull a room divider curtain aside and see the two struggling.

COOPER
Gentlemen!

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What's going on!

ALBERT
Thank god.

ALBERT walks over to COOPER, on the other side of the table, grabs him by the arm and pulls him over to DR. HAYWARD.

ALBERT
Cooper, this old fool is obstructing a criminal investigation. Cuff him.

DR. HAYWARD
He won't release Laura's body for the funeral. He's not human.

SHERIFF TRUMAN stands next to DR. HAYWARD.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What's the holdup?

ALBERT
Please Cooper, I do not suffer fools gladly and fools with badges never. I want no interference from this hulking boob, is that clear.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I've had just about enough of your insults.

ALBERT
Oh yeah, well I've had about enough of morons and half wits, dolts, dunces, dullards and dumbbells ... and you chowder head yokel, you blithering hayseed. You-you-you've had enough of me?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yes I have.

SHERIFF TRUMAN winds up and hits ALBERT across the jaw that sends him spinning and landing face to face on top of the body of LAURA PALMER. ALBERT turns his head to face him and feels his sore jaw.

ALBERT
Oh that's nice. How appropriate.

SHERIFF TRUMAN moves towards ALBERT but COOPER stops him.

COOPER
Wait in the car Harry.

ALBERT slowly gets himself off the table and SHERIFF TRUMAN leaves the room.

ALBERT
Thee ol' rustic sucker punch, huh. A hail of bullets would be nice!

COOPER
That's enough! The sheriff didn't mean anything.

ALBERT
He hit me.

COOPER
Well I'm sure he meant to do that. Albert, I want you to release this girl's body to her family immediately. I want your test results by noon. Those are orders.

ALBERT walks out of the room.

DR. HAYWARD
Thank you, Agent Cooper.

TUNE: LOVE THEME FROM TWIN PEAKS

DR. HAYWARD leaves the room. COOPER walks over to the body of LAURA PALMER and gently picks up her left arm, that is hanging off the table, and places it on top of her chest.

The front door of the PALMER HOUSE can be heard opening. We ZOOM IN on LELAND as he continues to watch the television. From the television we hear one of the programs characters, JARED.

JARED
My darling daughter Jade ... and Emerald. Because of my financial difficulties I have decided to end it all tonight.

CLOSEUP OF THE TELEVISION

At a desk, JARED writes a note as we hear his thoughts out loud.

JARED

INT. PALMER HOUSE - DAY

On the couch in front of the television with his right arm positioned to hold a cotton ball at the needle cut, LELAND turns his attention from the television to the woman calling his name. The woman is his niece, MADELEINE FERGUSON. She has features similar to LAURA but has black, wavy hair and wears large rim glasses.

The television show can still be heard in the background. From the program, a knocking on a door can be heard. JADE speaks from outside the house on the show.

JADE
(from the television) Daddy its Jade.

MADELEINE
Uncle Leland.

JADE
(from the television) Daddy please I know your in there. (doorbell buzzes)

LELAND
Madeleine?

JARED
(from the television) Jade, what a surprise.

MADELEINE nods and smiles at him. LELAND turns off the television, stands up and walks over to her.

LELAND
Mady, is it you?

MADELEINE
Uncle Leland, I am so sorry.

He hugs her as she begins to cry.

INT. DOUBLE R DINER - DAY

At a booth in the diner, NORMA JENNINGS, in her waitress uniform, is seated across from a parol officer, WILSON MOONIE. He shows her a prisoner picture, the front and side views holding a prisoner number, of her husband.

MOONIE
I'm sure Hank appreciates your unwavering devotion. Your husband has been a model prisoner. (puts the picture away in a folder) An inspiration to god and inmate alike. He greets the day with a smile and confound adversity with a kind word. Hank's parole hearing is scheduled for tomorrow, baring unforeseen circumstance. With your full support, before the board, he could be released shortly thereafter. Any questions?

NORMA
No.

MOONIE
Will you help find the job that Hank needs to effect a successful parole.

NORMA
Yes.

MOONIE
How exactly?

NORMA
I own the Double R, Mr. Moonie.

MOONIE
Well. Your quite a girl Norma. I bet you get all kind of Romeos in here begging for favors. How do you keep them from your door?

NORMA
I usually tell them I have a homicidally jealous husband who's doing 3 to 5 for manslaughter but expects to be a productive member of society real soon.

MOONIE
That should conclude our session for today Mrs. Jennings.

SHERIFF TRUMAN and COOPER stand in front of LEO JOHNSON'S rig looking out to the nearby lake.

COOPER
(amazed) Look at that. Ducks on the lake. (moves on) So fill me in on Leo Johnson.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Well Leo is one of those guys you keep on a list and keep your eye on. So far we haven't caught him with the paws in the cookie jar.

They both walk up to LEO who is chopping wood outside his house.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Morning Leo.

LEO
Who the hell is he? (gestures to COOPER)

SHERIFF TRUMAN
This is Special Agent Cooper, FBI. We'd like to ask you a couple of questions?

LEO
So ask.

COOPER
Leo, is that short for Leonard.

LEO
That's a question?

COOPER
Did you know Laura Palmer?

LEO
No. (splits a log)

COOPER
How well did you know her?

LEO
(aggressive tone) I said I didn't.

COOPER
Your lying.

LEO
I knew who she was alright, everybody did. (splits a log)

COOPER
Do you have a criminal record Leo?

LEO
Nothing, you can look it up.

COOPER
Illegal U-turn, April 1986; drunk and disorderly, November 1987; September '88, aggravated assault, charges dropped.

LEO
I paid my debt to society. (splits a log)

COOPER
Where were you the night of Laura Palmer's murder, around midnight?

LEO
On the road, I called my wife Shelly around that time from Butte Montana.

COOPER
She'll confirm this?

LEO
(aggressive tone) She will if you ask her.

EXT. BRIGGS HOUSE - DAY

TUNE: THE BOOKHOUSE BOYS (1:12 - 2:11)

We view the front of the house and see an American flag on a flagpole.




CUT TO:

INT. BRIGGS HOUSE - DAY

In the dining room, BOBBY BRIGGS, wearing a suit, is facing a christian cross hanging on the wall. He is smoking a cigarette. At first he looks at the cross and then stretches his arms out, imitating. Then he slowly moves toward it, with both hands, as if to grab it. MAJOR GARLAND BRIGGS, in his usual Air Force uniform, enters the room from the side.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Robert. (surprised, BOBBY turns to him) This may be a good time for a brief discussion.

BOBBY
You want to talk about cigarettes, today!

MAJOR BRIGGS
No, but put it out. Its a filthy habit especially for a varsity athlete.

BOBBY takes one last drag, turns to the table and extinguishes his cigarette in a ash tray. He then takes a seat at the table. His father follows suit next to him.

MAJOR BRIGGS
I have attended my share of funerals, too many. Anytime a man dies in war, he dies too soon. (places his hand on BOBBY'S shoulder, it annoys him) Laura died too soon as well.

BOBBY
Yeah, she did.

MAJOR BRIGGS
But we have a responsibility to the dead, Robert. Responsibility is the linch pin of our society. Each man responsible for his own actions. Each action contributing to the greater good.

BOBBY starts to play with his cigarette lighter; opening it, lighting it and closing it.

BOBBY
What's the good of putting someone in the ground.

BOBBY lights the cigarette lighter and places it on the table. As his father speaks, BOBBY waves his hand over the flame.

MAJOR BRIGGS
Its man's way of achieving closure. The ceremony begins understanding and the will to carry on without those we must leave behind. Robert, in your life you must learn, you will learn, to carry on without them.

BOBBY
Great.

MAJOR BRIGGS
I realize you experience an ongoing disinclination to enter a meaningful exchange. This leads to stalemate ... the desire on my part to pour certain wisdom upon you. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, sometimes its the best course available. Son don't be afraid. We'll all be there together.

BOBBY closes his lighter.

BOBBY
Afraid of what?

MAJOR BRIGGS
Well the funeral.

BOBBY
I'm not afraid of any damn funeral. Afraid? I can hardly wait. AFRAID! I'M GOING TO TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN!

BOBBY is upset but composes himself. MAJOR BRIGGS sits with a disenchanted look. BETTY BRIGGS, putting on handgloves, enters the room smiling completely unaware of what has just conspired.

BETTY
Everybody ready?




CUT TO:

INT. TWIN PEAKS SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT - DAY

COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN walk up a hallway in the building. DEPUTY TOMMY 'THE HAWK' HILL meets them as he enters the hall from a side door.

COOPER
Deputy Hawk.

HAWK
Agent Cooper, there's no sign of the man with one arm.

COOPER
Keep trying he's out there somewhere.

HAWK splits. SHERIFF TRUMAN and COOPER walk up to the door to the conference room.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
If anyone can find him, Hawk can.

COOPER
Tracker?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
The best.

COOPER
Oh. (look of admiration)

Together they enter the conference room where ALBERT is seated at the table.

COOPER
Okay Albert, what ya' got?

ALBERT
Enough forensic spade work to save your butt and get mine out of this god forsaking burg.

COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN sit together opposite ALBERT. Next to ALBERT is a television monitor and video cassette player along with a folder filled with the materials he has collected in his investigation of LAURA'S body.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What ya' got?

ALBERT gives him a smirk.

ALBERT
Okay, first of all, contents of envelope found in Palmer diary, cocaine. (throws a small packet to the table for them to inspect) Toxicology results also positive. News flash, the little lady had a habit. Next we got fibers of twine in bedded in her wrists and upper arms. (throws another small packet to the table for them to inspect) Two different kinds of twine. Fibers of twine found at railroad car match the sample from her wrists. The same twine was used to bind the wrists of the Pulaski girl. Conclusion, she was tied up twice and at different locations on the night of her death. Once here (points to his wrists) and once here (points to his upper arms) like this (places both arms behind his back).

COOPER is astonished as he remembers a line from the beautiful woman in his dream.

COOPER
Sometimes my arms bend back.

ALBERT
Here we got traces of pumice found in standing water outside the railroad car. (throws a small packet to the table for them to inspect) Soap industrial strength. I found identical particles in the back of Laura's neck. Its not her home use brand. My conclusion, the killer washed his hands and then leaned in for a kiss like this.

ALBERT acts out his description by showing how the hand would be under her neck to support it.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Good lord.

ALBERT plays a video tape. The tape shows a closeup of scratches on LAURA'S body that he points out.

ALBERT
Distinctive wounds found on Laura's neck and shoulder appear to be ... claw marks. Bites of some kind.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
An animal?

ALBERT
(smiles and points at TRUMAN; smartass) Look its trying to think.

COOPER doesn't react to his smartass remark. ALBERT shuts the monitor off.

ALBERT
Finally a small plastic fragment from her stomach partially dissolved by digestive acids. (throws a small packet with the item for them to inspect) I'm taking it back to the lab for reconstruction as the local facilities give new meaning to the word primitive. I note with some interest what appears to be the letter 'J'.

COOPER
Good work Albert.

ALBERT
Couple more days with the body who know's what else I might have found.

DEPUTY ANDY peers through the open door of the conference room.

ANDY
Sheriff, its time.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Excuse us. We ... have got a funeral to get to.

SHERIFF TRUMAN leaves the room. COOPER also gets up to leave.

ALBERT
Cooper, may I have a word with you alone?

COOPER stops short of the door and closes it for privacy.

ALBERT
There's one more item. Its a report concerning the physical assault on my person which you witnessed this morning. I think you find that's its quite accurate. Requires your signature.

ALBERT hands him the document and COOPER scans it over.

COOPER
Albert, I'm not going to sign this.

ALBERT
What?

COOPER
Albert, I hope you can hear me. I've only been in Twin Peaks a short time but in that time I have seen decency, honor and dignity. Murder is not a faceless event here. It is not a statistic to be tallied up at the end of the day. Laura Palmer's death has affected each and every man, woman and child because life has meaning here, every life. That a way of living I thought had vanished from the Earth but it hasn't Albert its right here in Twin Peaks.

ALBERT
Sounds like you've been snacking on some of the local mushrooms.

COOPER
With your behavior towards these good people, consider yourself lucky I do not file a report of my own that could bury you in the building so deep in Washington you'd never see the sun.

ALBERT, disgruntled, collects his paperwork and leaves the room, closing the door behind himself. COOPER, alone in the conference room, takes his tape recorder out of his pocket and looks at his watch.

COOPER
Diane, its 12:27 pm. I'd like you to look into my pension plan options regarding outside real estate investment. I may look into purchasing a piece of property at what I assume will be a very reasonable price.

TUNE: HAPPY THOUGHTS  18K

COOPER shuts his tape recorder off, puts the recorder back in his pocket, places his hands behind his back and smiles at the idea.

CLOSEUP and PAN of knick knacks on a wall divider/shelves near the living room. One of the knick knacks is a porcelain figure of a women with a patch. 'BIG' ED HURLEY is staring at one of the knick knacks. NADINE HURLEY runs into the room, throws her arm around him and kisses him.

NADINE
Love me.

BIG ED
You bet. (touches the knick knack he's been staring at) This a new one?

NADINE
Yes, isn't it beautiful. How do I look?

TUNE ENDS: AUDREY'S DANCE

BIG ED
Well, you look fine Nadine.

NADINE
Oh Ed, last night was wonderful. Oh my darling Ed, you came back to me. Now I feel like we're really together again. At high school I used to watch Norma and you at the football games. She was so pretty and you made such a handsome couple. But I knew, even though I was just ... a little nobody, just a little brown mouse. I always knew inside ... once you got to know me ... that we be together forever.

NADINE hugs him and lays her head on his chest. BIG ED has a distant look on his face. A motorcycle can be heard outside the house.

NADINE
That's not your bike is it Ed?

BIG ED
It's James.

NADINE
James who?

JAMES enters the house and sees NADINE in BIG ED'S arms.

BIG ED
We don't want to be late. Are you ready?

JAMES
I'm not going.

BIG ED
Its Laura, James.

JAMES
I can't, I just can't.

BIG ED
James!

JAMES walks out the house. The shout from BIG ED disturbs NADINE slightly as she is resting in his arms.

She enters a small space within the walls between the hallway and the Horne residency. Out of sight but in the HORNE residency of the hotel, BENJAMIN and SYLVIA HORNE are arguing over JOHNNY HORNE who is being helped by DR. LAWRENCE JACOBY.

BENJAMIN
... clear above this Sylvia I have my limits.

SYLVIA
Don't I know it.

BENJAMIN
Lies all straight and in my general direction.

SYLVIA
You can ...

AUDREY removes a wood panel from the wall to reveal a knot hole in the wood wall in the other room.

BENJAMIN
Taking it is the specialty of the house. Sylvia I'm going to make it extremely simple for ya'. We can't take Johnny to the funeral in that ridiculous getup.

We can hear BENJAMIN and SYLVIA continue to argue as we get AUDREY'S POV of JOHNNY and DR. JACOBY as she peers through the knot hole. JOHNNY is sitting on the floor wearing a large Indian headdress of feathers. DR. JACOBY sits opposite of him, very close and nearly face to face, as he whispers to him.

DR. JACOBY
Gotta go.

SYLVIA
Then let the great Dr. Jacoby see what he can do.

DR. JACOBY tries to remove JOHNNY'S headdress.

JOHNNY
No, no.

DR. JACOBY
You do it then.

SYLVIA
Am I going to have to call Dr. Jacoby every damn time I have a problem with Johnny?

Slowly JOHNNY removes the headdress and puts it on the floor. DR. JACOBY runs his hands through his hair to brush it down. JOHNNY is distressed and DR. JACOBY leans his forehead against his to comfort him.

BENJAMIN
Thank god. Alright lets everyone just get in the car.

AUDREY covers up the knot hole with the wood slat.

TUNE: LAURA PALMER'S THEME    

EXT. GHOSTWOOD MEMORIAL PARK - DAY

We start with a CLOSEUP of REVEREND CLARENCE'S face as he gives the sermon. Our view then switches to a bird's eye view of the crowd around casket. As REVEREND CLARENCE BROCKLEHURST gives his sermon, we view several different faces in the crowd starting with COOPER, DONNA HAYWARD, BOBBY and BIG ED. Next as the sermon continues we view COOPER follow BOBBY'S eyes to JAMES who has just arrived. BOBBY scornfully looks at JAMES. DONNA and JAMES look at each other. PETE has tears in his eyes as he looks at the casket. AUDREY and COOPER look at each other and smile.

REVEREND CLARENCE
I am the resurrection and the life. He that believe'th in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. And who shall ever live'th and believe'th in me shall never die. For none of us live'th to himself and no man die'th to himself. For if we live, we live unto the lord and if we die, we die to the lord. Whether we live therefore or we die, we are the lords. Blessed be the dead who die of the lord. Even so say'th the spirit. For they rest from their labors. The lord be with thee. Let us pray. Oh god entrust this child, Laura, to thy never failing care and love and bring us all to thy heavenly kingdom. Through the same, thy son, Jesus Christ our lord who live'th and reign'th with thee and the holy spirit. One god now and forever, amen. I baptized Laura Palmer. I instructed her in Sunday school and I, like the rest of you, came to love her with that special love that we reserve for thee headstrong and the bold. Laura was bright, she was beautiful, she was charming but most of all Laura was, I think, impatient. She was impatient for her life to begin. For the world to finally catch up to her dreams and ambitions. Laura used to say that I talked to much. I'll not make that mistake today. Just let it be said that I loved her and I will miss her the rest of my days.

JOHNNY
Aaamen! Amen!

REVEREND CLARENCE
Thank you Johnny.

BOBBY
AAAAAMENN!

From the back of the crowd BOBBY moves himself forward pushing people out of the way.

BOBBY
What ya' looking at? What are ya' waiting for? You make me sick. You damn hypocrites make me SICK! Everybody knew she was in trouble but we didn't do anything. All you good people, you wanna know who killed Laura. YOU DID! We all did and pretty words aren't going to bring her back man so save your prayers. She would've laughed at them anyway.

From the other side of the crowd, behind the crowd, JAMES rushes over to confront BOBBY. BOBBY sees him and reciprocates. MIKE NELSON also runs over. We view the action as COOPER, SHERIFF TRUMAN, DEPUTY HAWK, MAJOR BRIGGS and BIG ED rush to catch, and stop them from fighting.

BOBBY
You are dead man, your dead!

Our view of the scene is now SLOWED down as COOPER and BIG ED hold back JAMES, SHERIFF TRUMAN and MAJOR BRIGGS hold BOBBY and HAWK holds MIKE back.

BOBBY
Yyyoouurrr ddeeaadd!

SHERIFF TRUMAN
That's enough Bobby, that's enough.

BOBBY
Yyyoouu aarree DDEEAADD!

The action returns to NORMAL. JAMES stops his attempt as he is held back by COOPER and BIG ED but he stares down BOBBY. BOBBY continues to wrestle with his father and SHERIFF TRUMAN as he yells at JAMES.

BOBBY
Get off of me. You are a dead man, dead! You are dead man, dead! Get off of me.

Near the casket, LELAND is crying heavily for his daughter. Suddenly he spreads his arms out and throws himself onto the casket. SARAH PALMER screams. The casket, being held above the bottom of the grave by straps connected to a motor, starts to move down. The mechanical system is overwhelmed by the extra weight and generates a screeching metal sound as it fails.

LELAND
Oh my baby, Laura.

LELAND hugs the casket as it slowly moves down into the grave but the mechanical system kicks in again. It starts to raise the casket out of the grave but fails again and the casket goes down again. Again and again the mechanical system tries to lift the casket and fails producing the sound of screeching metal each time. SHERIFF TRUMAN and COOPER try to grab LELAND.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Leland.

REVEREND CLARENCE
The whole thing has gone haywire.

SARAH
(to LELAND) Don't ruin this too.

LELAND
(crying) My baby. Laura.

COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN try to reach for LELAND as the casket continues to move up and down in the grave.

CUT TO:

INT. DOUBLE R DINER - NIGHT

At the counter, SHELLY JOHNSON retells the scene at the funeral to two customers having a meal. Using a metal napkin dispenser and her hand, making an inverted peace sign, she visually shows what happened. 

SHELLY
This is the father (her hand) and this is the daughter in the coffin (napkin dispenser).

With her hand, SHELLY uses it to look like a small man on the edge of the counter. With her free hand she is holding the napkin dispenser off the counter but to the edge. Next, she shows how LELAND jumped on the casket by dropping her 'small man' onto the dispenser.

SHELLY
Boom.

She finishes by raising and lowering the napkin dispenser with her 'small man' on top. SHELLY also provides the sound effects of crying and of the broken machinery. The two customers laugh at it all.

We PAN to a booth in the background were BIG ED, SHERIFF TRUMAN and DEPUTY HAWK are seated. The table has three empty pie plates and cups of coffee.

BIG ED
I'm telling you Harry. He's just not going to figure this out.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Ed, that's a bet I'll take for the check. (COOPER enters) He's right on time.

BIG ED
Harry, careful who you trust. He's just not one of us.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Cooper. Take a seat.

COOPER
Harry, I got your note. Hawk, Big Ed. (nods to them)

SHERIFF TRUMAN
How would you like some fresh huckleberry pie?

BIG ED waves to NORMA.

COOPER
I would love a slice of pie. (NORMA arrives to take a food order) Norma, slice of huckleberry pie, heated, vanilla ice cream on the side, coffee.

NORMA
Coming right up.

Before she leaves, she looks at BIG ED and smiles. BIG ED has been starring at her and returns the smile. COOPER immediately makes the connection.

COOPER
Big Ed, how long have you been in love with Norma?

Completely surprised, BIG ED doesn't say a word. He just looks over to HAWK and SHERIFF TRUMAN, who is smiling.

TUNE ENDS: DANCE OF THE DREAM MAN (VARIANT)

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Ed, looks like pie and coffee's on you.

BIG ED grabs the check on the table.

COOPER
Okay, what you fellas call me in to talk about besides the highlights of the dinner menu?

BIG ED
Better tell him.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Somebody running drugs into Twin Peaks from across the border. We've been working this for six months trying to set up a bust: top to bottom, nobody walks.

COOPER
Who's targeted?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Jacques Renault, bartender at the Roadhouse. We figure him for the middle man. Now Ed's been doing some undercover. In fact, the night you got into town he was staking Renault out. We think Renault slipped him a mickey.

BIG ED
Felt like somebody hit me with a log splitter.

COOPER
Ed, I didn't know you were a deputy.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
He's not.

COOPER looks at SHERIFF TRUMAN, a little surprised, then returns to BIG ED.

COOPER
Well that's a little outside your jurisdiction, don't you think?

BIG ED
Somebody selling drugs to high school kids and I figure that's everybody's jurisdiction.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I call Ed in when I need him. He's not the only one I call.

NORMA arrives with COOPER'S pie and a pot of coffee. COOPER digs right into his pie as she fills his cup with coffee.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Thanks Norma.

NORMA
Enjoy.

COOPER
(relishing) Mmm, this must be where pies go when they die. Mmm.

TUNE: LAURA PALMER'S THEME    

COOPER
Okay Harry, would you please tell me why you really called me in here.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Cooper, your gonna have to go along with me on this. Even if it sounds a little weird.

COOPER
I'm with you.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Twin Peaks is different, a long way from the world. You've noticed that.

COOPER
Yes I have.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
That's exactly the way we like it but there's a ... back end to that that's kind of different too. Maybe that's the price we pay for all the good things.

COOPER
What would that be?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
There's a sort of evil out there. Something very, very strange in these old woods. Call it what you want. A darkness, a presence. It takes many forms but ... its been out there for as long as anyone can remember and we've always been here to fight it.

COOPER
We?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Men before us, men before them and after we're gone.

COOPER
A secret society. (wide eyed, great interest)

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Why don't we take Agent Cooper for a little ride.

INT. BOOKHOUSE - NIGHT

BIG ED, HAWK, SHERIFF TRUMAN and COOPER enter the Bookhouse, a darkly lit log building with a bar on one side of the room. Shelves, floor to ceiling, loaded with books divide the space, opposite the bar, into compartments.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
This is where we get together. Going on twenty years now.

COOPER
We meaning?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
The Bookhouse Boys. The coffee's free.

COOPER
I like the sound of that.

SHERIFF TRUMAN leads COOPER to a compartment where JAMES HURLEY and JOEY PAULSON guard a young man tied up in a chair with a gag over his mouth. The young man is BERNARD RENAULT a younger brother of JACQUES.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Cooper, you know James.

JAMES
Agent Cooper.

COOPER
James.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
This is Joey Paulson.

COOPER
Joey.

JOEY nods to COOPER.

COOPER
Who is this?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Bernard Renault, Jacques brother, janitor at the Roadhouse. Bernard came across the border this morning with an ounce of cocaine in his kitbag. I thought we'd ask him a few questions.

JOEY removes the gag over BERNARD'S mouth.

COOPER
Did you ever sell drugs to Laura Palmer?

BERNARD speaks with a heavy French-Canadian accent.

BERNARD
I don't sell drugs.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
How much does Jacques pay you to be the mule?

BERNARD
Jacques don't pay me nothing. I'm no mule.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
So that ounce you had that was for personal use?

BERNARD
That's right.

COOPER
I guess you don't get a whole lot of sleep at night then, huh Bernie.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Your brother didn't come into work the last few days. Where's he been?

BERNARD
I don't know. He got personal business.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Who else is he dealing with?

BERNARD
Why don't you ask him yourself? He be back tonight, in a minute.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
He's coming to work at the Roadhouse?

BERNARD
He the bartender isn't he.

COOPER
(leans toward BERNARD) Bernard, we got you tied up in a chair. Your mixed up with your brother in a wide variety of felonies. What I want to know is why in the world would you tell us where and when to find him?

SHELLY

LEO

LEO heads out the door. SHELLY places her purse on the kitchen table. LEO'S Corvette can be heard starting up and take off outside with a squeal from the tires. SHELLY removes a handgun from her purse and walks over to a cabinet. She pries apart a small panel above the doors from the cabinet, lays the gun inside beside the bloody shirt and replaces the panel.

JOSIE takes a drink from her wine glass. SHERIFF TRUMAN stares longingly at her.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
God, your beautiful.

She turns to him and smiles but returns to looking at the floor, somewhat sad.

SHERIFF TRUMAN

JOSIE and SHERIFF TRUMAN walk into the library. JOSIE shows him where the hidden safe is at behind a swing out section of the book shelves.

JOSIE
Andrew built this years ago. (using a key she unlocks it) I don't think Catherine knows that I know its here. (turns to look at TRUMAN, opens the door of the safe) Why do you think we have two sets of books?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
The usual reasons would have something to do with stealing maybe worse.

JOSIE looks into the safe and sees only one book, not the two she expects to find. She pulls out the one book and hands it to SHERIFF TRUMAN, who looks it over.

JOSIE
There were two. I saw them. You believe me don't you.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Of course I do. There's nothing unusual in this one.

PETE MARTELL walks in and sees her at her desk. PETE tries to back out unnoticed but she sees him. He knows he's been caught but tries to cover it up.

PETE
Have ... have you seen my tackle box?

CATHERINE
The next time you and the merry widow want to take a peek in my safe don't go through so much trouble. Be a man about it Pete. Ask me to my face.
