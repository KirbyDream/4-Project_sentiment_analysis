INT. LOG LADY'S CABIN - DAY

Seated at a dining table beside a tea set we see a woman, 'LOG LADY' MARGARET LANTERMEN. In her arms she carries a wooden log. She is speaking to us.

LOG LADY
Welcome to Twin Peaks. My name is Margaret Lantermen. I live in Twin Peaks. I am known as the log lady. There is a story behind that. There are many stories in Twin Peaks. Some of them are sad, some funny. Some are stories of madness, of violence. Some are ordinary. Yet they all have about them a sense of mystery. The mystery of life, sometimes the mystery of death. The mystery of the woods, the woods surrounding Twin Peaks. To introduce this story let me just say it encompasses the all. It is beyond the fire. Though few would know that meaning. It is a story of many but it begins with one and I knew her. The one leading to the many is Laura Palmer. Laura is the one.

BENJAMIN
Are they ready to sign?

LELAND
Are you not even going to mention that we have not as yet acquired access to the Packard land?

BENJAMIN hocks a loogey and spits it into the fire causing it to spark and crackle. LELAND turns away at the sight of this.

BENJAMIN
Sorry. (clears his throat) We have solid information. The Packard Saw Mill is going to go belly up within a year. We are going to able to get it for a song, one verse no chorus. Now let's get out there and get those cheese eaters where they live.

LELAND
Uhhh, Benjamin.

BENJAMIN HORNE is animatedly speaking to Norwegian businessmen. Sitting beside him is a translator that is interpreting his selling speech.

BENJAMIN
Clean, wholesome environment much like your very own. (translator speaks) With a quality of life to rival the very best. (translations) That this country has to offer and that is what the Ghostwood Country Club and Estates will be. Now, when I first spoke to Sven he was naturally very concerned about the quality of air. If you permit me Sven (motioning to SVEN JORGENSON) to repeat what you told me after your run, 'my air sacks (Ben breathes in deeply and pounds his chest on the exhale) have never felt so good.'

After the translation the crowd laughs.

JULIE, a hotel employee, approaches LELAND and whispers.

JULIE
Your wife's on the phone again. She says its urgent.

In the background the translator is speaking to the crowd in Norwegian and again the crowd laughs.

BOBBY
You heading out Shelly.

SHELLY
Yeah, I'm heading home.

BOBBY
I'm going to practice. I can drop you by your place on the way.

SHELLY looks at NORMA. NORMA is already looking at her, studying her expression.

SHELLY
That'd be great thanks.

BOBBY pays in loose change tossed on the counter. On the way out he approaches the jukebox.

BOBBY
Here's a tune for you gals. (places a coin in the jukebox) Okay, Norma. (points to NORMA) I'll see you in my dreams.

SHELLY
And what stage are we in now?

BOBBY

CATHERINE
Do you hear me! You can't do that to my workers. Don't walk away from me like that! Come on back here! Your not going anywhere and your not going to tell anybody anything.

JOSIE and CATHERINE enter the office. JOSIE turns around to face CATHERINE and says...

JOSIE
Catherine, I'm sorry if this offends you but I am the owner of this saw mill.

CATHERINE
And you don't know the first thing about this mill. That's why I'm running it.

JOSIE
I've never taken this authority before but maybe I should have.

CATHERINE
Your not shutting us down.

JOSIE
Catherine, I have the final say-so. Peter push the plug.

CATHERINE
Pete, don't you dare.

PETE has been watching the confrontation between both women.

PETE
Oh, Catherine. Please (walks over to the phone, picks it up) Shorty, tell the boys to pull the plug. (response) That's right.

COOPER
Diane, 11:30 am, February 24. Entering the town of Twin Peaks, five miles South of the Canadian border, twelve miles West of the state line. I've never seen so many trees in my life. As W. C. Fields would say I'd rather be here then in Philadelphia. Fifty-four degrees on a slightly overcast day. Weatherman said rain. If you get paid that kind of money for being wrong sixty percent of the time it beat working. My mileage is 79,345. Gauge is on reserve. Riding on fumes here. I've got to tank up when I get into town. Remind me to tell you how much that is. Lunch was ... uhh ... (retrieves a receipt from his pocket) six dollars and thirty-one cents at the ... Lamplighter Inn, that's on highway two near Lewis Fork. That was a tuna fish sandwich on whole wheat, slice of cherry pie and a cup of coffee. (emphasized) Damn good food. Diane, if you ever get up this way that cherry pie is worth a stop. Okay. (picks up card) Looks like I'll be meeting up with a ahh ... Sheriff Harry S. Truman. Shouldn't be to hard to remember that. That will be at the Calhoun Memorial Hospital. I guess we're going to go up to intensive care and take a look at that girl that crawled down the railroad tracks off the mountain. I'm pretty sure I'll be checking into a hotel. I'm sure the sheriff will be able to recommend a clean place, reasonably priced. That's what I need, clean place, reasonably priced.

COOPER
Dale Cooper, FBI (shakes hands). Pleasure.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Good to meet you.

COOPER clears his throat and they both proceed to walk up the hall.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Have any trouble finding the place?

COOPER
No, no trouble to find. I came out over Highway Two near Lewis Fork. I stopped at a little place called the Lamplighter Inn, had a slice of cherry pie, incredible.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Well I'll tell ya' we're sure glad to have the FBI here. We're kinda lucky in the way that Ronette step out across the state line. The whole town is very badly shaken up.

COOPER
Yeah, sure its a nice quiet place, something like this. (stops TRUMAN in the hall, now face to face) Sheriff let me just talk to you in the hallway here for just a second. There's a few things we got to get straight right off the bat. Now I've learned about this the hard way, its best to talk about it up front. When the bureau gets called in, the bureau's in charge. Now your going to be working for me. Sometimes local law enforcement has a problem with that. I hope you understand.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Like I said, we're glad to have you here.

COOPER now moves a little closer to SHERIFF TRUMAN and sports a grin.

COOPER
Sheriff, what kind of fantastic trees have you got growing around here? Big, majestic.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Douglas firs.

COOPER
(repeated in amazement) Douglas firs. (changes expression) Can someone give me a copy of the coroner's report on the dead girl.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Well the autopsy hasn't been done yet. But I'll take you down stairs to the morgue when we're finished here.

COOPER
Fine.

DR. SHELVY
Several times.

COOPER
One perpetrator?

DR. SHELVY
We're waiting for the results.

COOPER
(turns around to SHERIFF TRUMAN) Any connection to the dead girl?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Same high school. As far as we know they hardly knew each other. No connection.

COOPER
Hmm. I'd like to question her.

DR. SHELVY
This girl doesn't even know where she is or if she is.

COOPER
What exactly are you saying?

DR. SHELVY
We need a CAT scan and we are not equipped for that here. My opinion, she may have neurological damage. She's just not responsive at all.

COOPER
I'd like to examine her fingers?

DR. SHELVY looks at SHERIFF TRUMAN with a puzzled look. SHERIFF TRUMAN shrugs and gives a blank stare.

DR. SHELVY
All right.

COOPER moves over to RONETTE and grabs her left hand. With a small magnifying glass he looks at her fingernails.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
They've already scrapped for particles.

COOPER
Nah. That's not what I'm looking for. (continues looking) No, no. There's nothing here. Not a thing.

As COOPER puts her hand down RONETTE mumbles.

RONETTE
No. No. Don't go there. Don't ... don't go there.

DR. JACOBY stands quietly with his hands in his pockets and with large ear plugs in his ears. He wants to be greeted with COOPER.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
This is special agent Dale Cooper.

DR. JACOBY pulls out one of his ear plugs. Having misheard TRUMAN, he asks...

DR. JACOBY
Uhm, Gary Cooper?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Agent Cooper.

DR. JACOBY
Agent. (points at COOPER) F B I.

COOPER
Right.

DR. JACOBY
(slight laugh) Dr. Lawrence Jacoby agent Cooper. Laura was a patient of mine. Listen, your on your way to the morgue now. Do you mind if I join you?

COOPER
(scans DR. JACOBY from head to toe) Yes I do. Why would you want to?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
It's sort of against procedure doctor.

DR. JACOBY
Well, no offense. I ... I thought I could be of some help.

COOPER
You still could be, at another time.

DR. JACOBY
Oh. I ... I understand completely, yeah. Oh. By the way, (slight laugh) Laura's ... uhh ... Laura's parents ... (slight laugh) they didn't know that she was seeing me. (little crazed laugh)

COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN look at each other and then walk off. COOPER turns his head to look at DR. JACOBY and then to SHERIFF TRUMAN as they walk down the hospital hallway.

DOCTOR'S ASSISTANT
I have to apologize again for the fluorescent lights. I ... I think its a bad transformer.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What have you got here?

COOPER
Ring finger, under the nail. Let's see what he left us.

COOPER places the piece of paper on a small sheet of glass and flattens out the piece of paper. The small piece of paper has a single letter on it.

COOPER
Its an 'R'. Diane, give this to Albert and his team don't go to Sam. Albert seems to have a little more on the ball. (to SHERIFF TRUMAN) We need a bag and tag this.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(smile) Why not.

COOPER
(turns on his mini recorder). Diane, I just opened Laura Palmer's diary. This is the ... uhh ... last entry dated February 23. It reads, "asparagus for dinner again, I hate asparagus. Does this mean I'll never grow up." And then she's written, "nervous about meeting 'J' tonight". That's the letter 'J', Diane. (flips through the pages) Yeah, that is the last entry. Well that's something to get started on.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yeah. That's one out of twenty-six.

COOPER
Yeah, one out of twenty-six. (flips through the front pages of the diary) Diane, I just turned back eighteen days to day one. What we have taped to the page here is a plastic envelope containing a white residue and what looks to be a key to a safety deposit box. Sheriff, after you very carefully remove this key I'm going to run this envelope and my bet is it will test positive for cocaine.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(surprised) That's impossible.

COOPER
(looks at SHERIFF TRUMAN) You ever been surprised before?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Mr. Cooper, you didn't know Laura Palmer.

COOPER
Let's get started on a court order to open that safety deposit box and maybe we'll both find out a few things about Laura Palmer.

Okay, okay. Well I pretended to be typing but I was typing what Mike and Bobby were saying and ... well they didn't say exactly who it was they were talking about ... but anyway. Here's what they were saying.

Mrs. Horne it might help if you talk to Johnny yourself.

So, you think it might help. Well you can tell Johnny one more time that Laura isn't coming this afternoon to work with him (pause as she looks at Johnny) and tomorrow afternoon or any afternoon. Now what is so difficult to understand about that! (slams a fist to the table)

SHERIFF TRUMAN
It must have been a snowshoe rabbit.

COOPER
A snowshoe.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Right.

COOPER
A snowshoe, (amazed) snowshoe rabbit.

COOPER scans the room filling with people and spots an Asian woman walking forward.

COOPER
Who's the babe.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
That is one of the most beautiful women in the state, Mrs. Packard.

COOPER
Packard Saw Mill?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yep.

COOPER
Where's Mr. Packard?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Died in a boating accident last year. Andrew Packard practically built this town. Brought her over from Hong Kong, six years ago, left her everything. Which didn't exactly please his sister. That's her right there.

TRUMAN gestures to the woman, CATHERINE MARTELL, who is sitting on the other side of her husband, PETE MARTELL, that MRS. JOSIE PACKARD is sitting next to.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
The original deep freeze.

COOPER
Who's the glad handy dandy?

COOPER gestures to a man that has come up to JOSIE and is holding her hand.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Benjamin Horne, local big wig, he owns half the town. He's not after her, he's after her land.

MAYOR DWAYNE MILFORD, an elderly man, is at the podium banging a gavel. The lights in the room flicker on and off as a woman holding a log is switching them on and off to get people's attention.

COOPER
Who's the lady with the log?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
We call her the log lady.

The lights continue to flicker on and off as people slowly start to quiet down.

MAYOR
Ladies and gentlemen. Can I have your attention? (he looks around) Is this thing on? (pats the microphone) Is this thing on!

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Hang on mayor.

SHERIFF TRUMAN moves to the podium and adjusts the microphone as the MAYOR sits down.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Thank you Mayor Milford. Agent Cooper.

SHERIFF TRUMAN gestures to AGENT COOPER to come to the microphone. COOPER clears his throat as he approaches the podium.

COOPER
Thank you sheriff. Ladies and gentlemen, Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Dale Cooper. One year ago almost to the day in a town in the Southwest corner of this state the body of a young girl named Teresa Banks was found. She had no family, no one came forward to claim her body. It wasn't even news, until today. There are irrefutable similarities that for obvious reasons I can not discuss that lead us to conclude that Laura Palmer was the second and Ronette Pulaski would have been the third victim of the same killer. Now there is a chance that the person that committed these crimes is someone from this town, possibly even someone you know. You are the leaders of this community. It is vitally important that this not turn into a witch hunt. I would strongly suggest a temporary curfew for those under eighteen years of age. Keeping your kids off the streets now may teach them a degree of caution that may protect them in the days and the weeks to come. I will remind you that these crimes occurred at night.

DONNA returns to her room which she shares with her sister HARRIET HAYWARD. HARRIET is sitting up in bed with paper and pencil in hand.

It was kinda like a nightmare. Donna, she was a different person.

What are you saying?

I'm telling you there were things she was involved with, things she let herself get pulled into. Things she thought you hate her for. She said there were things about me ... she said even Donna doesn't know me.

I knew her, I knew her better then she thought I did.

Donna, she said something about a guy getting killed.

DONNA
Who?

JAMES
She didn't say but she said ... Bobby ... told her that he killed this guy.

Oh my god.

This is why I had to see you. It all makes some kind of terrible sense that she died. That someone killed her, I don't know I can't explain it. I didn't know whether to believe any of this last night. I mean half the time she wasn't making any sense. I couldn't calm her down. I could hardly keep her on the bike. We came to the light at Sparkwood and 21 and ... she ... she put her hands around my neck ... and she screamed she loved me. I looked into her eyes, they were clear. Its like she was Laura again. She was so sad. She sounded so desperate. Then she ran off ... (mumbles to a cry)

Why?

Because they found the half where she was killed and they think the killer will have the other half. If you go down there with the necklace and no alibi.

No.

DONNA
We'll hide it.

Alright. We'll bury it.

SHERIFF TRUMAN, eating a donut, and COOPER are seated in the parked police cruiser as JAMES and DONNA drive on by.

COOPER
What goes around comes around.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
And around and around.

SHERIFF TRUMAN turns on the police siren and pursues the motorcycle. JAMES pulls his motorcycle to the side of the road and stops.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
That's not Joey its James Hurley.

TRUMAN grabs his microphone for the cruiser's loudspeaker.

COOPER
I told you.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(through the loudspeaker) James, stand away from the bike. Stand away from the girl, put your hands behind your head.

JAMES complies by getting off his bike and, facing them, puts his hands on his heads. DONNA moves towards the police cruiser.

DONNA
He didn't do anything.

COOPER
She's probably right.

SHERIFF TRUMAN, slightly annoyed, looks at COOPER and then exits his vehicle.

DONNA
James, he didn't do anything.

INT. DR. HAYWARD'S VEHICLE - NIGHT

DONNA and DR. HAYWARD are sitting in his vehicle and are having a somber conversation.

DONNA
I'm sorry dad.

DR. HAYWARD
Donna, after what happened today. I'm sure you understand what you put your mother and me through tonight. But I also know you well enough to know you wouldn't have done it unless you had a good reason. But we also have another problem facing us young lady.

DR. HAYWARD
Well, we'll have to go get it. I understand you promised Harriet you'd put some air in the back tire.

INT. TWIN PEAKS SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

SHERIFF TRUMAN and COOPER enter the conference room holding cups of coffee and find the table laden with stacked donuts of all varieties.

COOPER
A policeman's dream.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yep. Lucy, sets it up for us every night.

LUCY
(over the intercom) Sheriff, is everything okay. There's extra jelly donuts for Agent Cooper and there's some extra decaf, (COOPER grabs a powdered donut) you know Andy's been drinking so much caffinated coffee lately ...

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Thank you Lucy. You can go back to work now and no listening.

COOPER breaks up his powdered donut, by hand, into little bite size pieces.

COOPER
Sheriff that reminds me. Can you recommend to me a good, inexpensive hotel or motel. Now it doesn't have to be fancy and I mean that.

COOPER eats a piece of donut and immediately wipes his hands with a paper napkin.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I can give you a good rate up at the Great Northern.

COOPER
Because you know I think I'm going to be here for some time and these motels, they'll promise you a good rate and then when you get there its a whole different story. Now all I need is a bed, a bathroom, a telephone and sometimes a television in the unlikely event that one day I'll get a chance to knock off early.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I can get you a good rate up at the Great Northern.

COOPER
Sold. (extends his hand to shake goodbye) Well, tomorrow come early

As COOPER heads out of the room he pulls out his mini tape recorder and turns it on.

COOPER
Diane, its 12:28 am. Looks like I'll be staying locally at a place called the Great Northern Hotel. The sheriff set the arrangements ... (walks off)

SHERIFF TRUMAN remains seated at the conference table laden with donuts and smiles to himself as he hears COOPER walk off.

BOBBY and MIKE are still gripping the cell bars and staring down JAMES who lays against the wall in his cell staring back at them.

BOBBY
When you least expect it.

BOBBY and MIKE then start to loudly bark (sounds like 'arf') like dogs at JAMES. Before they stop barking, BOBBY lets off a howling shout that turns into an odd howling scream that slowly trails off in volume. JAMES continues to just stare back at them.
