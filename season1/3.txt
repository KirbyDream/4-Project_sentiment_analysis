INT. LOG LADY'S CABIN - DAY

Seated at a dining table beside a tea set we see a woman, 'LOG LADY' MARGARET LANTERMEN. In her arms she carries a wooden log. She is speaking to us.

LOG LADY
Sometime ideas, like men, jump up and say hello.They introduce themselves, these ideas, with words. Are they words? These ideas speak so strangely. All that we see in this world is based on someone's ideas. Some ideas are destructive, some are constructive. Some ideas can arrive in the form of a dream. I can say it again. Some ideas arrive in the form of a dream.

INT. HORNE RESIDENCE - NIGHT

In the HORNE residence wing of the Great Northern Hotel, the HORNE family sits quietly around the dinner table. BENJAMIN HORNE and SYLVIA HORNE sit at opposite ends of a long dinner table while AUDREY HORNE and JOHNNY HORNE, wearing an Indian headdress, sit opposite each other near the middle of the table. Except for JOHNNY making a few odd sounds, the room is filled with the sounds of tableware clanking as the family eats. Until the door burst open and JERRY HORNE, BENJAMIN'S younger, wiry brother, walks in. JERRY looks back out at the hall.

TUNE: FRESHLY SQUEEZED (0:00 - 0:26) (W/O SNAPS)

JERRY
No, no, no, not in my room, in here, IN HERE!

BENJAMIN
Jerry, back from Paris.

JERRY is followed by four BELLHOPS, carrying luggage into the dining room.

JERRY
Ben, what a nightmare.

JERRY shakes his head, turns back to the BELLHOPS and points down.

JERRY
Right THERE, no, no, right there! What is with you guys. (the BELLHOPS place the baggage down) I've got a sandwich in there and I want all those bags opened. We're looking till we find it.

The BELLHOPS hop to it, all the bags are opened and they are scattering clothes around until they find several sandwiches wrapped in white paper. JERRY has moved over to AUDREY.

JERRY
Hey Audrey, uncle Jerry's back. Sylvia.

JERRY moves to SYLVIA as if to kiss her.

SYLVIA
Benjamin! (repulsed and angered by JERRY)

JERRY backpedals away from SYLVIA.

JERRY
Oh-oh, ohh, okay, okay ... gone ... goodbye. (laughs)

JERRY walks over to the sandwiches, picks them all up, places them on the table and unwraps one.

JERRY
Brother Ben, this is the best damn sandwich I ever ate, it's a baguette, with brie and butter, I had four of these damn things every day I was there. You gotta try this. (hands a sandwich to BEN) Here, go ahead, eat it, go ahead, go ahead.

Very interested, BENJAMIN takes the sandwich and draws his nose over it to smell it deeply.

BENJAMIN
Oh, yeah.

BENJAMIN really likes the smell of the sandwich. Grabbing the long ends of the sandwich, he takes a large bite out of it. With his mouth full he hums in ecstasy. JERRY unwraps himself one and sits nearby at the fireplace. JERRY'S mouth is soon full from a bite of his sandwich and is laughing at BEN'S reaction.

BENJAMIN
(with his mouth full) Uhm, this is incredible, Jerr.

JERRY continues to laugh with his mouth full as BENJAMIN madly takes another big bite out of his own sandwich. SYLVIA is annoyed by their actions. BENJAMIN and JERRY talk to each other with their mouths full.

BENJAMIN
You know what this reminds us of.

JERRY
Mmm.

BENJAMIN
(barely intelligible) Remember when we were kids.

JERRY
Mm.

BENJAMIN
It reminds us of Jeanne and Jenny down by the river. Do you remember? Hmm.

JERRY
My god, your right.

BENJAMIN
Am I right, am I right. Hmm.

JERRY
(laughs) Oh, no wonder.

BENJAMIN
Hmm, hmm. (laughs)

They now both laugh and hum with satisfaction from their sandwiches. BENJAMIN motions to JERRY to follow him.

BENJAMIN
Jerr, outside, outside.

BENJAMIN HORNE wipes his mouth, puts his napkin on the table, rises, smiles and looks around at his family.

BENJAMIN
Always a pleasure.

The rest of the HORNE family continue to eat silently at the table as BEN and JERRY leave the room. They both leave carrying their sandwiches and close the door to the dining room. SYLVIA has both of her hands to her bowed head in frustration.

JERRY

BENJAMIN
Yes.

JERRY

TUNE: LOVE THEME FROM TWIN PEAKS (0:00 - 1:14)

BENJAMIN
I can fix that. There's a new girl at One-Eyed Jacks, freshly scented ... from the perfume counter. And you, brother Jerr, have a fifty-fifty chance of being first in line.

They both laugh slightly.

JERRY
I like those odds. All work and no play make Ben and Jerry dull boys.

BENJAMIN
That's right.

JERRY
Let's jump in the boat.

BENJAMIN and JERRY walk away and we FOCUS on the wall they were standing by. The wall has a painting of a lake surrounded by the woods.

The cold, placid surface of Black Lake is illuminated by the moon. A 1942, solid mahogany 22 foot Fitzgerald and Lee custom streamliner runabout cuts through the water. BEN and JERRY sit together in the back seat as they are being chauffeured.

DR. HAYWARD
Well, Mrs. Hayward and I are going to say goodnight, James.

Good night, James.

JAMES
Good night.

EILEEN

Nine o'clock sharp.

DONNA
Okay.

The boat glides up slowly to the dock. The CHAUFFEUR tosses a line to a SECURITY GUARD to tie the boat to dock. Standing and watching is a gorgeous young female deckhand, SWABBIE, dressed in a skimpy, stylized sailor's uniform

BENJAMIN
Hi, sailor.

SWABBIE
Good evening, Mr. Horne.

BENJAMIN walks over to the SWABBIE, extends his arms as does she, rubs his hands over her elbows and smiles at her. JERRY comes up besides them.

JERRY
Now Ben, we're not gonna go into the casino first, are we?

BENJAMIN
Jerr, I didn't come here to lose my shirt, I just came to take it off.

JERRY
Yeah.

The BARTENDER presses a button, that buzzes, to call BLACKIE. BEN and JERRY enter by stairs to a plush, cozy warmly lit room with a small bar and a pool table.

JERRY
Yodehlaayeehoo.

BEN and JERRY approach the bar and JERRY orders the drinks from a scantily clad female BARTENDER.

JERRY
Sweetheart, I'd like to order two drinks, one double scotch on the rocks and my brother would like a double scotch on the rocks. (winks)

BARTENDER
That's two double scotch on the rocks?

JERRY
Next stop, rocket science.

TUNE: FRESHLY SQUEEZED (DARK VARIANT)

Several of the establishment's sensational and extraordinary WORKING GIRLS, known collectively as "The 52 Pick-Ups," enter the room one after another. They luxuriously arrange themselves standing into two rows. BEN and JERRY take note of them as they pick up their drinks. Through the middle of the line of girls sweeps BLACKIE "THE BLACK ROSE" O'REILLY, the Madam of the House, an intelligent, strikingly attractive woman in her mid-thirties.

BENJAMIN
(whispered) Wow. Blackie.

BEN walks over to her with his arms extended out to her.

BLACKIE
Benjamin.

BEN kisses her hand and walks around her as he recites ...

BENJAMIN
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate. (BLACKIE is amused, JERRY is bored and turns away to smile at the BARTENDER) Rough winds do not shake the darling buds of May, and every fair from fair sometimes declines. By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd. But thy eternal summer shall not fade. Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st, Nor shall death brag ...

JERRY walks up to them and interrupts by saying ...

JERRY
Where's the new girl?

TUNE ENDS: FRESHLY SQUEEZED (DARK VARIANT)

BENJAMIN has stopped reciting and is holding BLACKIE.

TUNE: LAURA PALMER'S THEME    

BLACKIE
When you really want love ... you'll find it waiting for you.

A curtain opens, revealing a gorgeous young WOMAN with the face of an angel. BEN and JERRY look at each other, then instantly back to the WOMAN. JERRY takes a coin out of his pocket, flips it, catches it on his wrist and covers it up. BENJAMIN calls it first.

BENJAMIN
Heads.

JERRY and BENJAMIN look down at the coin: heads. BEN smiles, kisses Blackie, pats his brother on the back, and starts towards the WOMAN.

TUNE: THE BOOKHOUSE BOYS (2:12 - 2:31)

As BENJAMIN slowly walks toward the WOMAN, she appears nervous and looks away slightly. Near her, BEN extends his palms up for her to guide him into the next room. The WOMAN'S nervousness disappears as she grabs his hands and guides him into the next room. JERRY watches.

JERRY
Wow.

BLACKIE
Come on, we'll take care of you Jerry.

JERRY, slightly depressed, is led to the bar by BLACKIE. JERRY looks at the BARTENDER.

JERRY
Well. (they both smile)

JAMES
Donna, I don't think that what we're feeling or doing is wrong.

DONNA
Why not?

TUNE: LAURA PALMER'S THEME    

JAMES
Because it's the truth. Because I think it would have turned out this way anyway.

DONNA
You do?

JAMES
Yes, I remember a time in school, in the hall, we were suddenly alone and we looked at each other. I almost told you I loved you then.

DONNA
It's true.

JAMES
It is true, isn't it?

DONNA
Oh James, I guess because of Laura, I couldn't say anything, I couldn't even let myself think it.

JAMES
Me too.

DONNA
(tender and trembling) Are we going to be together James? (she kisses him) Are we?

He kisses her.

DONNA

INT. DALE COOPER'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

The door flies open and FBI SPECIAL AGENT DALE COOPER enters his room. Still near the door he quickly pulls out his whittled whistle and blows twice on it. The telephone rings, he goes over, sits on the bed and answers it.

COOPER
Special Agent Dale Cooper.

HAWK
(over the phone) Hello, its Hawk.

COOPER
Hey Hawk, how's Ronette Pulaski?

HAWK
(over the phone) Body and spirit are still far apart.

COOPER
What did you find out from her parents?

HAWK
(over the phone) Ronette recently quit her job at the perfume counter of Horne's department store. Everything else is quiet except this afternoon there was a one-armed man snooping around intensive care.

COOPER
(stands up) A one-armed man?

HAWK
(over the phone) Left.

COOPER
Did you question him?

HAWK
(over the phone) Negative. I pursued, but he got away.

COOPER
Maintain an around the clock watch on Ronette and we'll speak in the morning.

There is a knock at the door just before COOPER hangs up the phone. COOPER hangs up, moves to the door and finds a note on the floor near the door. He picks it up, opens the door and looks around but finds nobody. He opens the note and it reads ...

BOBBY kneels down and reaches into a slit cut across the top of the hollow football. He pulls out a small packet of white powder.

BOBBY
Not all of it.

Behind a nearby tree, LEO JOHNSON turns on his flashlight and shines it up towards his own face.

TUNE ENDS: LAURA PALMER'S THEME    

LEO
Cash on delivery, Bobby.

LEO shines the light on BOBBY and MIKE and walks over to them. LEO is holding a shotgun in his left hand. BOBBY and MIKE look startled.

MIKE
(whispered to BOBBY) He's got a gun.

BOBBY
(rises slowly) Hey, Leo.

MIKE
Hey.

LEO, now facing BOBBY, shines his flashlight in his face. BOBBY sees someone behind LEO near a tree. This person after being seen hides behind the tree.

BOBBY
Who's that? Is there someone with you.

LEO
Never mind, toss it over here, quarterback.

BOBBY tosses the football to LEO.

BOBBY
It's empty.

LEO
Is that right? Weren't you supposed to leave something in there for me?

BOBBY
(holds up the bag of cocaine) This barely covers what we paid for. Where's the rest?

LEO
Where's the rest of the money?

MIKE
There's a ... there's a problem.

LEO
(shines the light on MIKE) Problem? (moves the light back to BOBBY)

BOBBY
Laura had the other half in a safety deposit box.

LEO
You think you got problems?

BOBBY
We can get it, Leo, just wait till everything settles down.

LEO
You punks owe me ten grand. (shines his light on his boots) Leo needs a new pair of shoes. (moves the light back to BOBBY)

BOBBY
Okay, we won't take delivery on the drugs until you get the cash.

LEO
Do I look like a bank!?

BOBBY
I appreciate your position, but this thing with Laura, how could I anticipate that kind of thing.

LEO
(grabs BOBBY'S jacket) Hey man, Laura was a wild girl.

BOBBY
Tell me about it.

LEO
Maybe. Someday.

LEO'S right next to BOBBY, MIKE is standing to the left side of BOBBY. MIKE reaches into his pocket. Without taking his eyes off BOBBY, LEO slowly swivels the shotgun around and trains it on MIKE and then places the light on his face.

LEO
Take your hand out of your pocket, Mike.

MIKE slowly takes his hand out and lifts them up.

BOBBY
What is your problem, Leo?

LEO
(shines the light on his own face) Problem? You want to know about problems?

BOBBY
Okay.

LEO
Your on the road ... driving back and forth, gone for days. You get back and guess what?

BOBBY
What?

LEO
You find out your old lady's been givin' it away.

BOBBY
Yeah?

LEO
Yeah. Steppin' out, in your own damn bedroom. That's a problem.

BOBBY
Yeah, I guess so. I guess it is. (LEO shines the light on his face) Do you know who?

LEO
A man needs a clean house.

BOBBY
Sure yeah ... so do you know who?

LEO
(moves the light to MIKE) I'll take care of it.

BOBBY
Sure you will man and this other thing, hell, we'll take care of that, don't you worry about that. We'll get the cash and everything'll be square.

LEO shines the light on his own face and laughs. He pauses for a while and stares at BOBBY then says ...

LEO
Go out for a pass.

BOBBY
What?

LEO drops the light, pumps the shotgun to load it and points it at BOBBY. MIKE and BOBBY are frightened and slightly raise their hands.

LEO
Go out for a pass.

BOBBY and MIKE back away from him.

MIKE
Geez. Just leave.

BOBBY
Okay, Leo.

LEO
Run!

MIKE
Just take it easy.

LEO

BOBBY and MIKE
Okay, take it easy, man! Take it easy!

BOBBY and MIKE turn and start running away from him, back towards the car. We view BOBBY'S point of view as he runs helter-skelter through the woods with his flashlight lighting the way.

As they reach the car, a football thuds onto the hood of the car, scaring the shit out of MIKE and BOBBY. They look at each other.

MIKE
Damn it, I'm done Bobby.

BOBBY

INT. HURLEY HOUSE - DAY

On the living room floor, NADINE HURLEY, in workout gear, is vigorously rowing on her rowing machine. Wearing a greasy gas station outfit, 'BIG' ED HURLEY enters the house and stops when he sees NADINE rowing away. BIG ED tries to tiptoe around behind NADINE so she doesn't see him but in doing so he steps on the drape runners and cotton balls laid out on the floor. Cotton balls and the drape runners scatter as BIG ED tries to keep from falling. Some of the grease from his hands falls on the cotton balls. NADINE hears the ruckus and stops rowing to see what has happened.

NADINE
Ed!

BIG ED
I'm sorry, honey, I didn't see it there.

NADINE
You stepped on my drape runner.

BIG ED
Well, honey, it was right out in the middle of the floor.

NADINE
You think that's an accident. I laid those out there myself, I was up all night working on that invention. I'm going to have the world's first 100% quiet runner!

BIG ED
Well I'm really sorry, Nadine.

NADINE
ED, YOU MAKE ME SICK!

BIG ED nods and moves into the other room. NADINE starts to row again. Pumped up with rage, NADINE grips the metal oars and pulls back on them. We hear NADINE grunting along with the screech of rending steel as she bends the oars back like willow sticks.

In the woods, behind the station, LUCY MORAN is holding the end of a tape measure to her nose. We follow the length of the tape measure to its other end and see a small table set up near a blackboard. The table is covered with stacked donuts of several varieties. At the other end of the tape measure is SHERIFF HARRY S. TRUMAN and DEPUTY TOMMY 'THE HAWK' HILL. They are using the tape measure to find the distance from LUCY to the nearby stump where an empty milk bottle has been placed on top. COOPER, with coffee cup in hand, is writing names with a piece of chalk on a blackboard near the table of donuts. COOPER looks over to SHERIFF TRUMAN.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
That's it, exactly sixty feet, six inches.

COOPER
Perfect.

At the stump, HAWK whispers to the SHERIFF TRUMAN, who shakes his head and answers.

Hey, baby, it's the big bad bobcat.

SHELLY
Are you crazy? What are you doing here?

BOBBY
I just passed Leo, he started to diesel up-out North Bend. We got at least twenty minutes.

SHELLY
(whispered to herself) Oh god. (to BOBBY) Where's your car?

BOBBY
Parked in the woods. Come on, open-says-me. Somebody might see me out here and that'd be worse.

SHELLY decides to partially open the door and speak to him, keeping her face out of view.

SHELLY
Bobby, you can not come by here like this. We can't see each other for a while.

BOBBY gently squeezes himself inside the house. SHELLY turns away from him but he gently grabs her and turns her around to see the bruises on her face.

BIG ED moves over and sits at the counter. NORMA places his coffee on the counter and leans slightly over the counter, on one elbow, next to BIG ED.

BIG ED
Its not the first time, it won't be the last ... but I'm in that dog house again.

NORMA
What happened this time?

BIG ED
Well I popped a grease gun, stepped on a drape runner and all hell broke loose.

NORMA
I ran into Nadine in the hardware store, that's all she talked about were those drape runners.

TUNE: THE BOOKHOUSE BOYS (0:36 - 0:58)

In the woods, a large blackboard is set up behind the station. A table is set up near the blackboard, covered with the fruits of LUCY'S morning donut run. Four folding chairs are set up near the table. They are all carry mugs of coffee. SHERIFF TRUMAN and HAWK are at the table of donuts. COOPER is at the blackboard and has just placed the chalk down. DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN stands near COOPER with a galvanized metal bucket filled with round rocks. 

ANDY
Where do you want these rocks?

COOPER
Put them right down there by the donuts, Deputy.

ANDY complies. LUCY picks up a coffee pot.

LUCY
Anyone for a warm-up?

EVERYONE
(severally) Ahh yeah, please ... thanks ... you bet ... thanks Lucy.

They all move over for their cups to be refilled. After being served more coffee, COOPER takes a sip and immediately spits it out on the floor. Everyone looks at him.

COOPER
Damn good coffee ... and hot! Would everyone please take a seat.

SHERIFF TRUMAN, HAWK, ANDY and LUCY sit on four folding chairs aligned facing the blackboard. COOPER takes a telescoping pointer out of his coat pocket and expands it to full length.

COOPER
By way of explaining what we're about to do, I'm going to first talk to you a little bit about the country called Tibet.

COOPER flips the two-sided blackboard over, revealing a detailed map of Tibet and surrounding countries tacked to it. The seated group all slowly lean forward.

COOPER
An extremely spiritual country, for centuries the leader of Tibet has been known as the Dalai Lama. In 1950, Communist China invaded Tibet and while leaving the Dalai Lama nominally in charge, they in fact seized control of the entire country. In 1959, after a Tibetan uprising against the Chinese, the Dalai Lama was forced to flee to India for his life, and has lived in exile ever since.

COOPER collapses his expanding pointer.

COOPER
Following a dream I had three years ago, I have become deeply moved by the plight of the Tibetan people, and have been filled with a desire to help them. I also awoke from the same dream realizing that I had subconsciously gained knowledge of a deductive technique, involving mind-body coordination operating hand-in-hand with the deepest level of intuition.

We view a CLOSEUP on LUCY, ANDY, HAWK and TRUMAN. We see that they are all intrigued, but completely mystified.

COOPER
Sheriff, Deputy Hawk, if you will please assist me, I will now demonstrate.

SHERIFF TRUMAN and HAWK look at each other and stand up. The blackboard is flipped to the other side. COOPER expands his pointer again.

COOPER
You will recall that on the day of her death, Laura Palmer wrote the following entry in her diary.

COOPER points to where this line is written along the top left side of the blackboard.

COOPER
Nervous about meeting 'J' tonight. Today we're going to concentrate on the 'J's.

COOPER circles the 'J' with chalk. SHERIFF TRUMAN and HAWK stand near him.

COOPER
Harry, when I give the word, would you please read aloud each of the names I've written on the blackboard.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Okey-doke.

COOPER
Deputy Hawk, stand over here (points near the bucket) and hold this bucket of rocks up near me where I can get at them. Would you please put on the kitchen mittens?

HAWK complies.

COOPER
Deputy Andy, move down, stand by the bottle.

ANDY rises, places his coffee on the donut table, and runs towards the distant rock, only too happy to help. HAWK now has the mittens on and is standing with the bucket in his hands.

COOPER
Lucy, take this piece of chalk. (calls out to ANDY) Not too near Andy!

ANDY moves over and LUCY takes the chalk from COOPER.

LUCY
Oh, I'm ... getting excited.

COOPER
And if I should strike the bottle after Sheriff Truman says a particular name, make a check to the right of that name. (turns to SHERIFF TRUMAN) Oh sheriff, I almost forgot, when you say the name, also briefly state that person's relationship to Laura Palmer. Ready?

LUCY
You did it, you hit it.

COOPER
Lucy, make a note that the bottle was struck but did not break, very important. Andy, put that bottle back exactly where it was!

LUCY and ANDY follow directions. COOPER nods to SHERIFF TRUMAN.

COOPER throws it again. The rock ricochets off a nearby tree, shoots off and hits ANDY in the head. ANDY reaches up with a gloved hand to his head.

COOPER
Sorry Andy.

LUCY
Sweetie?

ANDY
(immediately reassuring) It didn't hurt ... it didn't hurt a bit.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Where there's no sense, there's no feeling, Andy.

Except for LUCY, they all laugh slightly, including ANDY. As COOPER picks up another rock, SHERIFF TRUMAN pulls him aside to talk privately.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Coop, tell me ... the idea for all this really came from a dream?

COOPER
(smiles) Yes, it did.

SHERIFF TRUMAN walks back over to his spot near the blackboard.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(doesn't know who this is) Uh, Jack ... with One Eye.

LUCY
Maybe its the letter 'i' ... but there's no 'i' in Jack.

COOPER
I think perhaps it means he only had one eye, Lucy.

HAWK
Sounds like uh ... Nadine, Big Ed Hurley's wife.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
No no no, there's a casino up North called One-Eyed Jack's across the border on the Canadian side.

COOPER
That's it, we're gonna have to go up there and check that place out.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Okay.

LUCY
Agent Cooper, I'm going to erase this because it's a place and not a person. Actually, maybe the person could be in the place. So should I erase it?

COOPER
Yes.

LUCY
Yes, a person could be in the place or yes, I should erase it.

SHERIFF TRUMAN

AUDREY enters the diner and walks to the jukebox which is right next to the door. EILEEN, seated at a booth with DR. HAYWARD and DONNA, sees her first. The HAYWARD family are having pie and coffee.

EILEEN
Little Audrey Horne just walked in.

DR. HAYWARD
(turns to look at AUDREY) Yeah, saw her at church. I wonder what she's doing down here.

AUDREY places a coin in the jukebox.

TUNE: AUDREY'S DANCE

AUDREY moves over to the counter, removes her large black coat, folds and places the coat on a seat and sits down in an adjacent seat. NORMA comes over to take her order.

NORMA
Hi Audrey.

AUDREY
Hi Norma, could I have a cup of coffee please.

NORMA
Sure.

NORMA walks off to fetch her coffee. AUDREY turns to look at DONNA who is staring at her with a bit of a scowl. DR. HAYWARD is once again eating his pie and speaks to EILEEN.

DR. HAYWARD
Remind me to stop at the hardware store and get those sixty watt bulbs.

NORMA places an empty cup in front of AUDREY and fills it from a pot of coffee. NORMA looks her over, AUDREY appears preoccupied.

AUDREY
Thanks.

NORMA nods and walks off. AUDREY takes a sip of her coffee, places it back down and wipes the lipstick from where she drank it. Once again, she turns to look at DONNA. DONNA is still looking at her but without the scowl.

DONNA
I'm going to go say hi.

DONNA walks over to AUDREY and sits beside her.

DONNA
Hi.

AUDREY
Hi Donna.

DONNA
So my parents said they saw you at church today, I didn't see you.

AUDREY
Yeah, I came by because of Laura.

DONNA
What do you mean? I didn't even think you liked her.

AUDREY
There were things about Laura I didn't like, but she did help take care of my brother Johnny. Guess I sort of loved her for that.

AUDREY runs her finger around the rim of her coffee cup, staring into the cup.

AUDREY
Do you like coffee?

DONNA
Yeah, with cream and sugar.

AUDREY
Agent Cooper loves coffee.

DONNA
(smiles) Audrey.

They both giggle.

AUDREY
But Agent Cooper likes his coffee black.

AUDREY continues to run her finger around the rim of her cup of coffee. DONNA looks at her still grinning about what she said. AUDREY stops and looks at DONNA somberly.

AUDREY
Can I ask you something?

DONNA
Sure.

AUDREY
Did Laura ever talk about my father?

DONNA
What do you mean?

AUDREY
(looks away) Nothing.

DONNA
No, what do you mean.

AUDREY
He used to sing to her. (looks over to the jukebox) God I love this music. (turns to DONNA) Isn't it too dreamy.

AUDREY gets up from her seat, walks over to an open area of the floor near the jukebox and starts to seductively sway to the sound of the music. EILEEN sees her dance and gestures to DR. HAYWARD to take a look. From her seat, DONNA looks oddly at her as she moves to the music.

Seated together in the conference room, SHERIFF TRUMAN opens a folder containing a sealed plastic envelope with a small blood soaked towel inside and shows it to COOPER.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Can you believe this, Hawk found this half mile down the tracks from the crime site.

Using tweezers, COOPER pulls the towel out of the bag and spreads it out.

COOPER
Oh, that's a nasty piece of work.

Three men in black suits, hats and sunglasses enter the building, each carrying a stainless steel suitcase. The front man is AGENT ALBERT ROSENFIELD, a brilliant, mannerless FBI forensics expert, the others are his ASSISTANTS. LUCY looks up from behind the reception window with a book on Tibet in her hands.

ALBERT
(abruptly) Tell Agent Cooper that Albert and his team are here.

LUCY
Albert?

ALBERT
a - l - b - e - r - t. Are we going to have to stand here all afternoon?

LUCY
No.

LUCY reaches over the intercom microphone but ALBERT interrupts her before she can say anything.

LUCY

SHERIFF TRUMAN presses a button on top of the intercom unit to reply.


SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yes he is.

With his eyes still on the bloody towel, COOPER snap his fingers and points to the intercom unit.

COOPER
Are Albert and his team here, Lucy?




CUT TO:

At her seat in the reception office, LUCY is surprised he knows. ALBERT is fidgeting with a cigarette in his hand.

LUCY
Yes, he is ... they are.

COOPER

LUCY
(to Albert) Agent Cooper will be right with you.

ALBERT
Yeah, I can hear perfectly well, curly.

ALBERT turns to one of his ASSOCIATES who lights his cigarette. None of them see LUCY stick out her tongue at ALBERT.

Still seated in the conference room, COOPER turns to SHERIFF TRUMAN.

COOPER
Harry, Albert and his team are the cream of the crop. Albert's a forensics genius.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Working for you, I wouldn't expect anything less.

COOPER places his left hand on SHERIFF TRUMAN'S shoulder.

COOPER
But I gotta warn ya, Albert's lacking in some of the social niceties.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Nobody's perfect.

COOPER
Isn't that the truth?

SHERIFF TRUMAN looks over to his shoulder. COOPER quickly grabs his nose with left hand and makes a 'quack' sound. They both laugh.




CUT TO:

INT. TWIN PEAKS SHERIFF DEPARTMENT - DAY

COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN walk into the reception area and up to ALBERT and his team. COOPER is grinning as ALBERT says ...

ALBERT
What the hell kind of a two-bit operation are they running out of this tree house, Cooper?

COOPER
Albert, this is Sheriff Truman.

ALBERT
I have seen some slipshod backwater burgs, but this place takes the cake.

SHERIFF TRUMAN has a somewhat angered look on his face. COOPER knows ALBERT well and keeps his cool with a large smile.

ALBERT
What are you waiting for, Christmas? We've got work to do damn it. They're putting this girl in the ground tomorrow and we've wasted half the day traveling out here to the middle of nowhere.

COOPER
Al ... Albert, I suggest you and your team should get started.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I'll have one of my men escort you over to the morgue.

ALBERT
That'll be fine.

COOPER
(hands ALBERT a file) Results from the local pathologist's report.

ALBERT
(scans it scornfully) Welcome to amateur hour. (to his men) Looks like an all-nighter boys.

They pick up their suitcases.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(moves to ALBERT) Albert, got a minute?

SHERIFF TRUMAN pulls ALBERT aside from the group to talk to him privately.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I hear that you're real good at what you do.

ALBERT
Yeah, that's correct.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Well that's good, because normally if a stranger walked into my station talking this kind of crap, he'd be looking for his teeth two blocks up on queer street.

ALBERT and SHERIFF TRUMAN look eye-to-eye. ALBERT blinks first, puts on his shades, and heads out. His men follow. LUCY enjoyed the confrontation and smiles as they leave. SHERIFF TRUMAN looks at COOPER, who, with a smile, gives him a thumbs up.

BIG ED
Oh my god.

BIG ED is frightened at the tone of her voice. NADINE bursts into the room and runs as if to tackle him. He's a little apprehensive as she approaches but she runs into him and gives him a big hug.

NADINE
Oh Ed, I'm so happy, sweetheart, I have to thank you.

BIG ED
Why's that?

She looks up at him, her eyes wide and bright.

NADINE
You don't know what you've done for me.

BIG ED
No, I don't.

NADINE
Oh Ed, you big lug. When you tracked all that grease into the house today, you spilled some on my cotton balls, but instead of tossin' 'em out I put the greased ones on the runners ... and Ed, just listen to this.

She moves over to the drapes, opens and closes the curtains and unlike before they make no noise or sounds at all.

NADINE
Completely silent.

CATHERINE
Everything smells like fish around here.

PETE
Well you could wash your socks separately.

CATHERINE walks into the bathroom holding a small jar. PETE quietly rises, silently picks up a small vase from the dresser, dumps the contents into his hand and takes out a small key with a tag.

CATHERINE
(from the closet) What did that FBI man want up here today?

PETE
Nice fella. Asked a few questions.

CATHERINE
About what?

PETE
He talked to Josie mostly. I had a problem with a fish, took a liking to my percolator.

CATHERINE
What did he want to talk to Josie about?

PETE

Cautiously peering to make sure CATHERINE does come out of the bathroom, PETE walks to the bedroom door, opens it and hands the key over to JOSIE PACKARD, who was waiting near the door. They whisper to each other.

PETE
Here's the key, the ledger inside.

JOSIE
Thank you.

PETE
You bet.

PETE sits back down on CATHERINE'S bed and continues to wipe his boots as CATHERINE reenters.

CATHERINE
Didn't he want to talk to me?

PETE
Yeah, but we told him you were on your world tour, he should contact your press agent.

CATHERINE
(angrily) Get your boots off my bed and go to your room!

PETE rises, collects his boots and mink oil.

PETE

SONG: PENNSYLVANIA 6-5000

He walks into the center of the room and then turns his head to LAURA'S picture on a nearby table. LELAND moves to photograph and picks it up. Slowly, at first, he starts to spin around in place holding the photo at arms length. Faster and faster he spins and starts to moan and then wail. Startled by the sound and the music, SARAH PALMER enters the room to see LELAND dancing and wailing.

SARAH
(frightened) Leland? ... Leland? ... Stop it, stop.

LELAND
We have to dance, we have to dance, Sarah. We have to dance for Laura.

SARAH
Oh Leland, stop it, give it to me.

LELAND
We have to dance.

SARAH
Leland, Leland give it to me.

SARAH tries to take the picture out of his hands as he continues to spin. In the struggle they slam LAURA'S picture onto a table and cut themselves on the broken glass. LELAND wipes the blood on SARAH'S and his own hand and smears it on the photograph as he cries, thinking of his daughter.

SARAH
What is going on in this house!

SARAH screams and walks over to the record player and slaps the stylus away from the record. The music stops.

In a dimly lit room, a man, seen before walking through the hospital, with one arm speaks.

ONE-ARMED MAN
Through the darkness of future past, the magician longs to see. One chants out between two worlds ... fire ... walk with me. ... We lived among the people. I think you say, convenience store. We lived above it. I mean it like it is, like it sounds. I too have been touched by the devilish one. Tattoo on the left shoulder ... oh, but when I saw the face of god, I was changed. I took the entire arm off. My name is Mike. His name is Bob.

In a basement we see the man from SARAH'S vision, BOB, a frightening long-haired man, stands beside machinery in a dark room. He looks toward the ceiling as he speaks.

BOB
Mike? Mike, can you hear me?

BOB, in the same surroundings, has one hand on his chest and the other pointing at us as he speaks.

BOB
Catch you with my death bag. You make think I've gone insane ... but I promise, I will kill again.

We return to viewing COOPER tossing and turning in his bed and return to the first portion of the dream ...




MORPH TO:

INT. WAITING ROOM

We see a large, windowless, well-lit, sparsely furnished, red-draped room with a table and three easy chairs. DALE COOPER, twenty-five years older, sits in one of the chairs. Next to it is a coffee table with a model of Saturn. A LITTLE MAN, three and a half feet tall, in a red suit, stands with his back to COOPER, shaking violently. Two of the easy chairs are close together. Beside them are two tall Saturn lamps. A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN who looks exactly like LAURA PALMER sits across from COOPER in one of those chairs.

COPPER stares at the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN and she stares back at him. He turns to look at the LITTLE MAN. The LITTLE MAN stops shaking, turns to COOPER and claps his hands once.

LITTLE MAN
Let's rock!

The LITTLE MAN moves over and sits in a chair beside the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. The LITTLE MAN closes his eyes and rubs his hands slowly together, a ringing sound is produced.

SOUND EFFECT: SPIRIT PRESENCE RINGING   20K

COOPER looks at the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, who is still staring at him and smiles enigmatically. She slowly puts a finger to the side of her nose and then slowly lowers her hand, almost pointing at him as it drops. As the LITTLE MAN rubs his hands, a shadow of a bird passes in the background behind the red drapes.

Both the LITTLE MAN'S and the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN'S speech is oddly stilted but COOPER'S speech is normal. We see subtitles under them, with the correct words. The LITTLE MAN stops rubbing his hands, opens his eyes, turns to COOPER and says ...

LITTLE MAN
I've got good news! That gum you like is going to ... come back in style.

COOPER sits quietly listening to him and turns to the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. The LITTLE MAN turns to look at the WOMAN and then back to COOPER.

LITTLE MAN
She's my cousin, ... but doesn't she look ... almost exactly like Laura Palmer?

COOPER
But it is Laura Palmer. Are you Laura Palmer?

BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
I feel like I know her, (distressed) but sometimes my arms bend back.

LITTLE MAN
She's filled with secrets. Where we're from, the birds sing a pretty song ... and there's always music in the air.

TUNE: DANCE OF THE DREAM MAN

Strange saxophone music filters into the air. The LITTLE MAN hops off the chair and begins to dance a strange dance. A light, like a strobelight, flashes on and off. The BEAUTIFUL WOMAN rises, goes over, and gently kisses COOPER on the mouth. She then softly whispers something in his ear.
