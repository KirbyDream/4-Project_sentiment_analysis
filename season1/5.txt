FADE IN:

INT. LOG LADY'S CABIN - DAY

Seated at a dining table beside a tea set we see a woman, 'LOG LADY' MARGARET LANTERMEN. In her arms she carries a wooden log. She is speaking to us.

LOG LADY
Even the ones who laugh are sometimes caught without an answer. These creatures who introduce themselves but we swear we have met them somewhere before. Yes, look in the mirror. What do you see? Is it a dream, or a nightmare? Are we being introduced against our will? Are they mirrors? I can see the smoke. I can smell the fire. The battle is drawing nigh.

EXT. PALMER HOUSE - DAY

We view the front of the house.




CUT TO:

INT. PALMER HOUSE - DAY

In the living room, we view a photograph of LAURA PALMER as the homecoming queen. Our view PANS the room to a sketch that DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN, using a charcoal pencil and a pad of paper, is drawing from a description that SARAH PALMER is giving to him of the frightening man she saw in her vision. SHERIFF HARRY S. TRUMAN sits in a chair opposite them. DONNA HAYWARD sits next to SARAH.

SARAH
Yeah, yeah. His hair was long, filthy gray on gray, long hair.

MADELEINE FERGUSON walks up to SHERIFF TRUMAN with a silver coffee set and offers him some coffee. He grabs a cup of the tray and looks at her. MADELEINE, with her long black hair and thick rim glasses, smiles.

SARAH
I saw him ... at the foot of Laura's bed. He looked like an animal.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Have you ever seen this man before?

SARAH
No, never. His face, my god, his face. (becomes upset)

LELAND PALMER enters the room, wearing a robe, looking like he just woke up.

LELAND
Sarah, did you tell them about the necklace? (SARAH composes herself) Your gonna love that one.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What necklace?

LELAND
(holds up two fingers) She's had two visions. (walks off)

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Go ahead Sarah.

SARAH
Leland? (walks after him) Leland?

SARAH stops roughly where he was standing.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Sarah.

She turns to SHERIFF TRUMAN and tells her earlier vision.

SARAH
Its night. A flashlight beam moves across the ground. A hand, a gloved hand, lifts a rock and takes out a necklace, broken in half. It was Laura's.

DONNA listens and appears disturbed from the realization of SARAH'S vision.

We view a CLOSEUP on the television and see the end of the intro for the television program 'Invitation to Love' as its tune swells down over a blue background with a note shown with a scarlet red flowing script that writes out the program's title on virgin white paper.

ANNOUNCER

TUNE ENDS: INVITATION TO LOVE   28K

The INTRO for the show FADES OUT. The show FADES IN to a nerdy looking man, CHET, with thin greasy hair and glasses, and to EMERALD, a woman with long hair and wearing a lot of costume jewelry. CHET is seated and EMERALD stands beside him running her fingers though his hair.

EMERALD
Don't fight it Chet. You know as well as I there's still something between us. (looks at her greasy hand) There always will be.

CHET
For god sake Emerald. That may be true but I'm married to your sister now. It's wrong.

EMERALD
Well, you always said you could never tell us apart so ...




CUT TO:

INT. TWIN PEAKS SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT - DAY

In the reception office, we see that it is LUCY MORAN, chewing on a pencil top, is watching the program very closely. SHERIFF TRUMAN and DEPUTY ANDY enter the building and walk up to the reception window.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Morning Lucy. What's going on?

LUCY
Uhh thanks to Jade, Jared decided not to kill himself and he's changed his will, leaving the Towers to Jade instead of Emerald but Emerald found out about it and now she's trying to (TRUMAN and ANDY look at each other in befuddlement) seduce Chet to give her the new will so she can destroy it. Montana's planning to kill Jared at midnight so the Towers will belong to Emerald and Montana but I think she's going to double cross him and he doesn't know it yet. Poor Chet.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What's going on ... here?

LUCY
Uh, Agent Cooper is in the conference room with Dr. Jacoby.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Thank you.

SHERIFF TRUMAN walks off toward the conference room. ANDY moves closer to the reception window.

ANDY
(softly) Lucy, why couldn't I spend the night last night?

LUCY
Will you be having coffee Deputy Brennan?

ANDY shies away from LUCY'S cold reply.




CUT TO:

INT. TWIN PEAKS SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT - DAY

In the conference room, DR. LAWRENCE JACOBY sits at the long end of the table with the blackboard, with a map of Tibet, in the background. He wears a pair of glasses with one red lens and one blue lens. AGENT COOPER sits at the other end of the table sternly watching DR. JACOBY perform a magic trick. The magic trick has two white balls between the fingers on one hand. He taps that hand against his head and one ball disappears. He opens his mouth to reveal the ball. DR. JACOBY performs the trick twice before COOPER asks ...

COOPER
Was Laura Palmer seeing you because she was addicted to cocaine?

DR. JACOBY
Agent Cooper, I'd like to help ya' but uh ... got a little problem here, uh. Look may-maybe there's some sort of hula we can do around my doctor / patient confidentiality, huh.

COOPER
It is safe to say she came to you because she was having problems?

DR. JACOBY
Oh my yes.

COOPER
Were her problems of a sexual nature?

DR. JACOBY
Agent Cooper, the problems of our entire society are of a sexual nature.

DR. JACOBY stands up, walks over to the blackboard with the map of Tibet and looks it over.

DR. JACOBY
Tibet. (smiles) You know, my abiding interests lie to the East as well but only as far as Ha-vai-i (Hawaii). The ancient Hawaiians often turn to the soothing rhizome of the ginger plant to ease the pain of profound confusion. Which, more often then not, was sexual.

COOPER
Ginger is nonaddictive, cocaine is.

DR. JACOBY
Look the-the fact that-that Laura Palmer sought medication, no matter how dubious, was actually a positive sign.

COOPER
Dr. Jacoby, I understand you cared deeply for Laura Palmer. Why is it that you won't help us?

DR. JACOBY moves toward COOPER.

DR. JACOBY
My ... own ... personal investigation, I suspect, will be ongoing for the rest of my life.

SHERIFF TRUMAN enters the room. Now close to COOPER, DR. JACOBY bends slightly to him and says ...

DR. JACOBY
Laura ... had ... secrets ... and around those secrets she built the fortress ... that, well that in my six months with her, I was not able to penetrate and for which I consider myself ... an abject failure.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Doctor, did Laura ever discuss Bobby Briggs or James Hurley with you?

DR. JACOBY
Now they were boys, Laura was a woman.

COOPER
She had sex with three men the night she was murdered. Were you one of them?

DR. JACOBY looks as if he is going to proudly say yes but sighs and says ...

DR. JACOBY
No.

COOPER
Who killed her Dr. Jacoby?

DR. JACOBY
The night after Laura died, I followed a man that uh ... Laura had spoken to me about. He was driving a red corvette. I followed him to the old sawmill road and then I lost him. And that gentlemen is all I can tell you.

The intercom unit buzzes. LUCY'S voice can be heard over the speaker.

LUCY
Agent Cooper, there's a Gordon Cole on the phone. He say's your expecting his call. Should I put him through?

COOPER
Yes Lucy, put him through. Thank you doctor that will be all.

DR. JACOBY heads out but is stopped at the door by a question.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
You'll be in town doctor?

DR. JACOBY
Well, I'm planning a pilgrimage to Pebble Beach ... but that's not till the end of the month. Hang loose howies.

DR. JACOBY gives a hang loose hand sign and leaves the room.

COOPER
Does Leo Johnson drive a red corvette?

COOPER moves to a small table along the wall, picks up the intercom unit and places it on the table.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yes.

COOPER
How we doing on Jacques Renault?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
There's an APB on him. His brother made bail this morning. I got an all points on him too.

COOPER composes himself before turning the intercom unit on. The man speaking over the intercom is GORDON COLE, COOPER'S superior.

COOPER
Harry this is my supervisor. (presses the button on intercom unit) Good morning Gordon. How we doin'?

GORDON
(over the speaker) Cooper, where do we start? The Palmer girl or Albert's new best friend, Harry Truman.

SHERIFF TRUMAN, a little worried, walks over to the window.

COOPER
Laura Palmer.

GORDON
Albert has been very busy. The twine he found in her upper arm is a common household variety, Finley's Fine Twine.

COOPER
And the twine on her wrists?

GORDON
Definitely not a match. No ID yet and those marks on her shoulders, bird bites.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Bird bites?

GORDON
He'll also be faxing a reconstruction of the plastic fragment from her stomach.

COOPER
Great, tell Albert we're anxiously waiting his results.

GORDON
Now for the bad news Coop. I got an OJ and a AFO here from Albert concerning his mano y mano with the local Sheriff Truman. Albert wants this guy's badge Coop.

A little agitated, COOPER stands up and becomes rather animated as he talks.

COOPER
Gordon, here's how it is. You know Albert. In my opinion Sheriff Truman displayed the patience of a saint 'not' clocking him a day earlier then he did.

GORDON
He wants it filed with the US Attorney.

COOPER
File it under 'F' for forget it.

GORDON
Cooper?

COOPER
And you tell Albert that if he wants to pursue this I'll fight him all the way up the chain to Washington.

DEPUTY ANDY walks into the room.

GORDON
Cooper? Coop, don't get excited and hang up on me now.

COOPER
Talk to you later Gordon.

COOPER presses the button on intercom unit to hang up.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Thanks. I didn't ... get a whole lot of sleep last night.

COOPER
Harry, the last thing I want you to worry about, while I'm here, is some city slicker I brought into your town relieving himself upstream.

ANDY hands COOPER the drawing he produces using SARAH'S description from her vision.

COOPER
This is the man I saw in my dream.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
You saw this man?

COOPER
I had an intuition that my dream and Sarah Palmer's vision were connected. I didn't go with you this morning because I didn't want to influence her. I'm a strong sender. (to ANDY) The eyes were a bit closer together.

The intercom buzzes and LUCY can be heard from the speaker.

LUCY
Deputy Hawk calling in for Agent Cooper.

COOPER picks up a nearby phone.

COOPER
Hawk. (reply over the phone) Right. Stay there. Follow him if he moves.

COOPER hangs up the phone and turns to SHERIFF TRUMAN and ANDY.

COOPER
Traveling East on highway 12, how long will it take us to reach the Timber Falls Motel?

SHERIFF TRUMAN and ANDY answer simultaneously.

ANDY
Half in hour.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Ten minutes.

ANDY
Depends how you go.

COOPER
Hawk's found our one-armed man.

CATHERINE
I wished I could have seen Josie's face, opening the safe for her lawman Romeo. To show him the double set of books ...

BENJAMIN
Where's the book that spells bankruptcy.

CATHERINE
Uhm, I have more then one hiding place. My desk upstairs.

MONTANA
(from the television) God forgive me.

EMERALD
(from the television) Oh darling don't be so ...

CATHERINE
There's a drop panel on the top drawer. Not even Pete the poodle knows about that one. I'm famished.

CATHERINE and BENJAMIN take a sip of wine. We can hear the television program.

MONTANA
(from the television) Let's get one thing straight I didn't spend the evening busting up the Amazons by dodging blow darts ...

CATHERINE
I suppose room service is too much to expect of this rusticated mildew farm.

BENJAMIN
You would prefer the lumber baron's suite at the Great Northern.

CATHERINE
I'd prefer getting on with setting the torch to that damn mill.




CUT TO:

EXT. TIMBER FALLS MOTEL - DAY

SHERIFF TRUMAN and COOPER drive up in TRUMAN'S police cruiser. DEPUTY TOMMY 'THE HAWK' HILL comes up to them as they drive up. A woodpecker can be heard in the background. As SHERIFF TRUMAN steps out, HAWK points and says ...

HAWK
Harry, he's here at the motel. Room 101, last name is Gerard.




CUT TO:

INT. TIMBER FALLS MOTEL ROOM - DAY

BENJAMIN and CATHERINE lie at the foot of the bed.

BENJAMIN
Now when the mill goes up in smoke. The headline that we're after is Josie Packard torches bankrupt mill in insurance fraud. Not giant wienie roast in the woods.

CATHERINE laughs. He nudges her on.

BENJAMIN
Hmm, hmm.




CUT TO:

EXT. TIMBER FALLS MOTEL - DAY

SHERIFF TRUMAN, with his gun drawn, walks up towards the motel room door where the ONE-ARMED MAN, PHILLIP MICHAEL GERARD, is staying. As he walks, he passes a timber truck rig full of large tree logs. AGENT COOPER and DEPUTY ANDY are right behind him. ANDY has his hand on his gun, still in its holster. COOPER draws his gun and stands behind ANDY. SHERIFF TRUMAN knocks on the door.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Mr. Gerard, its the police, open up.

ANDY fumbles with his gun to pull it out of the holster and drops it. The revolver discharges when it hits the ground. SHERIFF TRUMAN and COOPER jump. COOPER is furious for the loss of control in a serious situation. He spins around and shouts.

COOPER
Geez!

SHERIFF TRUMAN ducks down, picks up the gun and hands it to ANDY.




CUT TO:

INT. TIMBER FALLS MOTEL ROOM - DAY

BENJAMIN gets out of bed and moves to the window to see what has happened outside. CATHERINE calmly lays back on the bed.

CATHERINE
Gun play. Sounds serious.

BENJAMIN turns to her with a look of seriousness.

SHERIFF TRUMAN, AGENT COOPER and DEPUTY ANDY are still standing outside the door of the ONE-ARMED MAN, MR. GERARD. They all have their guns drawn and directed toward the door.

SHERIFF TRUMAN

SHERIFF TRUMAN kicks the door in.

INT. TIMBER FALLS MOTEL ROOM - DAY

SHERIFF TRUMAN and COOPER rush in to the room and find MR. GERARD at the closet drawer wearing only boxer shorts.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Don't move!

ONE-ARMED MAN
Oh my god!

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Put your hands where I can see them.

Slowly MR. GERARD moves away from the closet drawer to reveal a missing left arm that was concealed behind the closet door. He stands with his right arm raised. SHERIFF TRUMAN and COOPER lower their guns and look at each other.




CUT TO:

INT. TIMBER FALLS MOTEL ROOM - DAY

BENJAMIN moves away from the window holding a small figure. CATHERINE is still in bed.

BENJAMIN
You uh ... let me know if there's any blood shed.

We see what BENJAMIN is holding a small doll with the likeness of Elvis. He picks up his folded clothes off the bed. Unknowingly something falls out of the pocket of his pants to the floor. CATHERINE notices it. BENJAMIN wiggles the doll in his hand at her and says ...

BENJAMIN
I'm going to give little Elvis ... a bath.

He puts the doll in his robe pocket and walks to the bathroom.

INT. TIMBER FALLS MOTEL ROOM - DAY

SHERIFF TRUMAN and COOPER stand next to a seated ONE-ARMED MAN, MR. GERARD, who is looking at the drawing of the man from SARAH'S vision.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What do mean you don't know him? You know this man.

ONE-ARMED MAN
No sir. I've never seen that man before in my life ...

TUNE ENDS: LAURA PALMER'S THEME    

ONE-ARMED MAN
... but you know something he ... he kinda looks like somebody. Doesn't he?

COOPER
Mr. Gerard, do you have a friend named Bob?

ONE-ARMED MAN
Oh, Bob Lydecker is just about my best friend in the world.

COOPER
Why have you been at the hospital the past two days?

ONE-ARMED MAN
Bob's in a coma.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
There was a Lydecker assaulted three days ago outside a bar. In Lowtown.

ONE-ARMED MAN
That's Bob. (nods)

COOPER
Is your friend Bob a doctor?

ONE-ARMED MAN
He's just about the best dern veterinarian in these parts?

HAWK is on the phone near a bedside stand.

HAWK
Thanks. (hangs up) He's clean, no record, no warrants.

HAWK tosses MR. GERARD'S wallet to SHERIFF TRUMAN, who hands it to COOPER. COOPER scans it over before handing it to MR. GERARD. SHERIFF TRUMAN gives HAWK an order.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Take a look at his car.

We watch DEPUTY ANDY nervously move and peer at a closed suitcase standing atop a table.

COOPER
Your middle name is Michael?

ONE-ARMED MAN
Named after my uncle.

COOPER
How'd you lose the arm?

ONE-ARMED MAN
Car accident. I was on the road from Memphis to ... uh ... someplace. Selling pharmaceuticals. (waxing enthusiasm) Pretty good job.

A commotion of rumbling comes from the side of the room. We view ANDY slightly embarrassed as he fumbled in opening the suitcase causing its contents of shoes to spill out onto the table and the floor.

ONE-ARMED MAN
That's what I'm selling these days. Everybody needs shoes.

ANDY
There all for the right foot.

ONE-ARMED MAN
Its my sample case. (picks up a shoe) Yeah, two day delivery, guaranteed. Oh and we could certainly take care of all your departmental needs.

COOPER
The arm you lost, did it have a tattoo?

ONE-ARMED MAN
What's this all about? I'm a shoe salesman.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Settle down Mr. Gerard. He just asked you a question.

COOPER
If you won't tell us, we can find out. What did it say?

ONE-ARMED MAN
(moved to tears) It said ... Mom. (cries)

HAWK
Car was already staked out when I got here. It was Josie Packard.

In a girl's bathroom, DONNA applies lipstick as AUDREY walks in and lights up a cigarette. The bathroom has one wall lined with mirrors and sinks. The other side of the room is lined with toilet stalls. The walls and doors of the bathroom are decorated with two red lines that wrap around the room and form two peaks at intervals.

AUDREY
I've been doing some research. In real life there is no algebra.

DONNA
Maybe you should run away and join the circus.

AUDREY
Escape. I got a better idea. A tall, dark and handsome stranger falls madly in love with me. Takes me away to a life of mystery and international intrigue

DONNA
You mean the FBI agent? Dream on.

AUDREY
Maybe ... or maybe he'll realize that I'm the woman of his dreams because I'm going to help him figure out who killed Laura.

DONNA
Is that so.

AUDREY
Yeah ...

TUNE ENDS: FRESHLY SQUEEZED

AUDREY
... and your gonna help me. Fact; Laura was seeing James Hurley behind Bobby's back.

DONNA is now combing her hair.

DONNA
What if she was.

AUDREY
So it is true. Fact; Laura had a sweet tooth for nose candy.

DONNA
Well I guess that's not such a big secret.

AUDREY
I didn't know Laura half as well as you and I knew the score, Laura was wild. Come on will you help me?

DONNA
What else have you figured out Sherlock?

AUDREY
The morning of the funeral, Dr. Jacoby is talking to my brother Johnny, trying to get him to go to the funeral. So he tells Johnny that Laura's in a better place now blah-blah-blah and he knows that because ... Laura was his patient.

DONNA
Laura was seeing Jacoby?

AUDREY
It gets better. You ever heard of One-Eyed Jacks?

DONNA
Isn't that that western with Marlon Brando?

AUDREY
Its a place across the border. They have girls working there.

DONNA
Are you saying you think Laura was one of them?

AUDREY
I don't know but if its true wouldn't you want to know about it.

DONNA
Well, it sure'd explain a few things.

AUDREY
You know I think about it ... I think about Laura being in a place like that and I get all shivery ... but its like a hot cold. Like when ... you hold an ice cube on your bare skin for a long time.

DONNA
Audrey, I'll help you but whatever we find out we have to promise to keep it between ourselves. Our secret.

AUDREY
Its a deal ... and I know exactly where to start. (school bell rings) Did you know that Ronette and Laura worked in the same place?

DONNA
No.

AUDREY

HANK leans to her slightly.

HANK
You've got to back me up in there Norma, please. I got to get out. There starting to put the zap on me big time. I know I have no right to ask of you and you have no reason to believe but ... I'll change. I swear on my life, I have changed. Give me a chance to prove it to you.

HANK
I've replayed it in my mind a million times and I just don't have any answers. A car, in perfect condition, goes out of control. A vagrant, nobody knows, is killed ... while sleeping by the roadside. Why? Why did fate deal me this hand?

PAROLE JUDGE #1
You were not incarcerated for an act of fate Mr. Jennings.

HANK
I accept that ... but it was fate. Maybe, in an odd way, even luck that sent me to prison. Just as much as the car accident.

PAROLE JUDGE #2
What is your point?

HANK
I know I have a lot to make up for. For the life I destroyed and for another life ... (turns to NORMA) I very nearly destroyed.

PAROLE JUDGE #2
Mrs. Jennings, your husband would be facing a difficult reentry. How would you help him?

NORMA
I own the Double R Diner in Twin Peaks. I can give him a job. The boss is tough but fair.

PAROLE JUDGE #2
And you would live together as man and wife?

NORMA
Well he is my husband, isn't he?

We see two old gas pumps labeled 'Indian Head' as SHERIFF TRUMAN and COOPER drive up in TRUMAN'S police cruiser and park along side them. Before they exit the vehicle, COOPER peers outside the window above the store and says ...

COOPER
In my dream, Mike said he and Bob lived above a convenience store.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Cooper, I'd think you'd be afraid to go to sleep at night.

They both exit the vehicle and walk to the building next to the convenience store. In the background, HAWK gives a high five to a FRIEND.

FRIEND
Hey Hawk.

COOPER stops as ANDY walks up to him. SHERIFF TRUMAN walks on up the steps of the entrance and looks at the pet a small girl holds, who is sitting on the steps.

COOPER
Andy, could you go into the One Stop and get me some twine.

ANDY
Okay.

ANDY walks off. COOPER walks to the building next door, a veterinarian clinic. The log building has a sign above it, 'Aid to the Beast Incarnate'. COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN climb the stairs to the entrance and walk in.

At the reception window, COOPER talks to the RECEPTIONIST and shows her the sketch of the frighting man from SARAH'S vision..

RECEPTIONIST
No, that's not Dr. Lydecker.

COOPER
Does Dr. Lydecker treat birds?

RECEPTIONIST
Why yes, of course.

SHERIFF TRUMAN pulls COOPER away from the window to speak to him.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
You know there are plenty other vets in Twin Peaks.

COOPER
Yes, but only one has a best friend with one arm. Harry ...

A llama disrupts AGENT COOPER as he speaks with SHERIFF TRUMAN by walking between them and even nearly touching his face with its face. The llama snorts as it walks by.

COOPER
... in the heat of the investigative pursuit the shortest distance between two points is not necessarily a straight line.

ANDY walks up to COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN.

COOPER
Andy, hand me that spool of Finley's Fine Twine.

COOPER briefly scans it and then hands it to SHERIFF TRUMAN. SHERIFF TRUMAN studies it and looks at ANDY as COOPER walks off to the reception window.

COOPER
Mrs. Lumer, where going to have to confiscate your files.

RECEPTIONIST
What?

COOPER returns to SHERIFF TRUMAN.

COOPER
Harry, as clear as the signs on the turnpike, the bird that attacked Laura Palmer is a client of this office.

SHELLY
Oh, I feel so bad for you. I was watching you at the funeral. My heart was aching. I wanted to hold you so much. (kiss)

BOBBY
That James Hurley. He was seeing Laura behind my back. I'm gonna fix him.

SHELLY
Fix me first. (kiss)

BOBBY
When is Leo due back?

SHELLY
Don't worry bad boy. I can hear his 'vet a mile away.

BOBBY
Don't mess around with this Shelly. Where is he?

SHELLY
He's with his friend. That creepy Jacques.

She continues to kiss. BOBBY'S mind is elsewhere as he thinks about what she just said.

BOBBY
Jacques ... who?

SHELLY
That Canuk guy that works at the Roadhouse.

BOBBY
Leo and Jacques?

SHELLY
What's the matter?

BOBBY gets up from chair, lifting SHELLY. She is a little confused by his actions.

BOBBY
Gotta think ... I gotta think.

SHELLY
Uhm well ... think later Bobby. I have to get back to the diner in half in hour.

BOBBY
I gotta tell you something.

SHELLY
What? What is it?

BOBBY
I've been on to this for a while and I've been checking it out. Its pretty bad.

SHELLY
Tell me.

BOBBY
Leo and Jacques are running drugs across the border, cocaine. And-and the-they've been selling them at school.

SHELLY
I knew it. I knew Leo was messed up in something.

BOBBY
I think its even possible they were giving drugs to Laura.

SHELLY
Bobby, I have to show you something.

She walks over to a cabinet, pries off a panel and takes out the bloody shirt that she had stashed there.

SHELLY
This was in Leo's truck two days after Laura was murdered.

BOBBY
Are you sure this is Leo's?

She fiddles with the shirt trying to find the collar and reveals 'LJ'.

SHELLY
It has his initials sewn in the collar. He makes me sew them into everything.

BOBBY
Shelly, ... this ... this could be the answer to our prayers.

SHELLY
What do you mean?

BOBBY
You don't need to know. I'm going to take this, okay. You never saw this. Say it. I never saw it.

SHELLY
I never saw it.

BOBBY
Leo's not going to be a problem for us anymore. Just stay clear of him, keep quiet.

She moves back to the cabinet, reaches into the stash compartment and pulls out a gun.

SHELLY
I bought this.

BOBBY
Do you know how to use it?

SHELLY opens the top of her waitress uniform, revealing some lingerie, and holds the gun to her chest.

SHELLY
I thought you could teach me. Teach me Bobby.

BOBBY lustily stares at her, spits his gum out to the floor and moves to her.

We view AGENT COOPER, SHERIFF TRUMAN, DEPUTY HAWK and DEPUTY ANDY enter the building. COOPER, HAWK and ANDY are carrying boxes of files from the veterinarian clinic.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Fellas, take'em right into the conference room.

SHERIFF TRUMAN moves to the reception window to speak to LUCY.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Lucy, I need you to go through these files and pull out all people who own birds.

LUCY
How will I know they own birds?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
It will say so on the cards.

LUCY
Okay, I'll start going through files then.

INT. TWIN PEAKS SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT - DAY

In the conference room, we watch HAWK, ANDY and COOPER place the boxes of files, marked 'Lydecker Clinic', on and around the conference table. ANDY speaks to COOPER.

ANDY
Agent Cooper I'm so sorry I don't know what happened. My gun just slipped out of my hand.

COOPER
Well Andy, have you every used your weapon in the line of duty?

ANDY
No sir, I haven't. I can't explain what happened. I've been feeling a little high strung.

COOPER
Well, it was lack of preparation. We'll take care of that.

SHERIFF TRUMAN pokes his head through the open door of the conference room.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Andy, get some ammunition from the lock box. Meet us downstairs at the pistol range.

COOPER pats ANDY'S shoulder before he and SHERIFF TRUMAN walk off.

In the hallway, COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN pass LUCY, who is carrying a plant watering pitcher. ANDY enters the hall and moves over to LUCY.

ANDY
Lucy, did you hear what happened? I feel so dumb. I dropped my gun and it went off.

LUCY
Are you all right?

ANDY
Oh yeah, I guess so but ...

LUCY
I would like to chat but I am now under orders to examine these files. So if you excuse me please.

LUCY walks off. ANDY is again bothered by LUCY'S cold reply.




CUT TO:

INT. TWIN PEAKS SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT - DAY

In the pistol range, we watch COOPER, SHERIFF TRUMAN and DEPUTY HAWK enter and pass Christmas decorations stored at the sides of the entrance to the room. COOPER is loading his gun as he speaks.

COOPER
Laura Palmer's murder was vicious and calculated. There's no telling what we'll encounter bringing a suspect to ground. After Andy's mishap at the motel. I want to make absolutely certain each of us is comfortable and confident with our firearms.

HAWK notices COOPER'S gun before he puts it back in its holster.

HAWK
Nice piece.

COOPER
Actually its standard issue. I made a few modifications. (privately to TRUMAN) How long has Lucy been upset with Andy?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(points at COOPER) Body language?

COOPER
In this case it was yelling through a megaphone.

ANDY walks in.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Six rounds a piece to start with Andy.

ANDY
Okay.

COOPER
Care to tell us about you and Lucy, Andy?

ANDY
Geez, you can tell?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Not to many secrets left around here.

ANDY
She won't speak to me and I don't know why ... and I don't know why she doing what she's doing. I just can't figure her out.

COOPER
Well there's no logic at work here Andy. Let that one go. In the grand design women were drawn from a different set of blueprints.

HAWK
Amen to that.

HAWK puts on his ear protection cover.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Amen. Hawk, Andy.

The rest also put on their ear protection cover.

COOPER
Rapid fire.

HAWK confidently and quickly fires his gun at the practice target down the gunnery range. ANDY has a hard time just holding on to the gun as he quickly fires. When their finished, the target sheets are retrieved from the distant shooting area by a motorized line. They all remove their ear protectors and rest them on their shoulders around their neck. HAWK collects the target sheets and hands them to COOPER. COOPER checks over the target sheets to see how they scored.

COOPER
Hawk, six for six. Two kills, high marks. Andy. (ANDY'S target sheet has no holes) Andy what we need is practice and lots of it. One hour, three times a week. Harry you'll supply the ordinance.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Whatever it takes.

HAWK and ANDY walk to opposite sides of the room.

COOPER
Chin up Andy. (nods his head up)

SHERIFF TRUMAN
You ever been married Cooper?

SHERIFF TRUMAN pulls out his gun and checks it.

TUNE: LAURA PALMER'S THEME (ONE INSTRUMENT V2)

COOPER
No. I knew someone ... once who helped me understand commitment, responsibilities and the risks. (pulls out his gun and puts on his ear protection) Who taught me the pain of a broken heart.

Confidently and without blinking COOPER quickly discharges his gun at the target. SHERIFF TRUMAN also confidently fires. After firing, the target sheets are retrieved. They remove their ear protection and retrieve their target sheets. Before they look them over HAWK says ...

HAWK
One woman can make you fly like an eagle another can give you the strength of a lion but only one in the cycle of life can fill your heart with wonder and the wisdom that you have known a singular joy. I wrote that for my girlfriend.

COOPER
Local gal?

HAWK
Diane Shapiro, Ph.D. Brandice

COOPER, impressed, whistles. He returns his attention to the target sheets.

COOPER
Harry, one miss five hits. Three kills, excellent.

SHERIFF TRUMAN silently looks over COOPER target sheet and then hands it to HAWK.

HAWK
Only four hits?

COOPER
Well I put four through the eyes and one through each nostril.

We view the target sheet and see two holes where the eyes and where the nostrils would be in the human form of the target sheet.

HAWK
Nice pattern.

LUCY speaks over the intercom.

LUCY
Agent Cooper, I'm looking at the files from Dr. Lydecker's and, for instance, I have here in the 'A's an Arky who's a part poodle part rottweiler, who lives on Maple and belongs to Mr. Rumple. Then, for example, I have an Annette who's an otter, who lives with a family near Elk river.

COOPER
We wanted the name of birds.

LUCY
I know but the files are all organized alphabetically.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Lucy, go through the bird file.

LUCY
No no you don't understand. Their organized alphabetically in the names of the pets.

COOPER realizes that finding the bird is going to take quite a while.

COOPER
We're going to need some more coffee.

It isn't that I'm ashamed of you, Audrey. Its just that I'd wish I could depend on you more. Especially during a trying time like this.

AUDREY
Well that's what I wanted to talk to you about. Dad, I want to change my life. I've decided I want to help you with the family business. I mean, one of these days you'll need someone to take over and obviously it's not going to be Johnny.
