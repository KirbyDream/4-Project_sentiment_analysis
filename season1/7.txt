FADE IN:

INT. LOG LADY’S CABIN - DAY

Seated at a dining table beside a tea set we see a woman, ‘LOG LADY’ MARGARET LANTERMEN. In her arms she carries a wooden log. She is speaking to us.

LOG LADY
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Yet there are those who open many eyes. Eyes are the mirror of the soul, someone has said. So we look closely at the eyes to see the nature of the soul. Sometimes when we see the eyes, those horrible times when we see the eyes, eyes that ... that have no soul. Then we know a darkness, then we wonder. Where is the beauty? There is none if the eyes are soulless.

INT. DALE COOPER’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

FBI SPECIAL AGENT DALE COOPER sits at the corner of his bed as he speaks somberly and gently to AUDREY HORNE, who is undressed and in his bed under the sheets.

COOPER
Audrey your a high school girl. I’m an agent of the FBI.

MUSIC: TWIN PEAKS THEME    

AUDREY is teary eyed.

AUDREY
So do you want me to leave or what?

COOPER takes a deep breath as he ponders what to say.

COOPER
What I want and what I need are two different things Audrey.

COOPER takes another deep breath.

COOPER
When a man joins the bureau he takes an oath to uphold certain values. Values that he’s sworn to live by. This is wrong Audrey, we both know it.

AUDREY
But don’t you like me?

COOPER
I like you very much. Your beautiful, intelligent, desirable. Your everything a man wants in his life. But what you need right now, more then anything else, is a friend. Someone who will listen.

AUDREY wipes tears from her eyes. COOPER reaches into his pocket and pulls out a handkerchief for her.

AUDREY
Friends huh.

COOPER nods yes. AUDREY brightens with a smile. COOPER returns with a smile.

COOPER
Now I’m going to go down and get us two malts and some fries downstairs. Then I want you to tell me all your troubles.

AUDREY
That could take all night.

COOPER
The night is young.

COOPER stands up.

COOPER
Now I’m going to get the food ... and your going to get dressed.

AUDREY
I can’t tell you all my secrets.

COOPER
Secrets are dangerous things Audrey.

AUDREY
Do you have any?

COOPER
No.

AUDREY
Laura had a lot of secrets.

COOPER
Finding those out is my job.

AUDREY watches COOPER leave the room. COOPER closes the door behind himself. AUDREY breathes a sigh of relief.

CUT TO:

INT. TWIN PEAKS SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT - DAY

DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN slowly enters the building. ANDY peers to the reception window before he passes the second set of glass double doors, clears his throat and walks toward the reception window. LUCY MORAN, in the reception office, greets ANDY but tries not to look at him.

LUCY
Good morning Officer Brennan.

ANDY
I’d sure wish you’d stop calling me Officer Brennan.

LUCY
Officer Andy this is peak activity time at the station switchboard. So its really not convenient for me to talk right now.

The phone beside LUCY RINGS and, as a distraction, she quickly answers it.

LUCY
Twin Peaks Sheriff’s station. May I help you? (reply) One moment please.

LUCY puts her hand over the receiver and stares at ANDY. ANDY walks off. LUCY returns to the phone.

LUCY
Dr. Stonacheck. Yes its me. (reply) Oh. (reply) Ah-ha. (reply) Well thank you doctor. (reply) No, I’m fine. (reply) Bye.

LUCY hangs up the phone.

COOPER enters the building through the front doors, blowing his whittled WHISTLE.

COOPER
Mornin’ Lucy. I heard that you were out sick yesterday.

Depressed, LUCY doesn’t look up at COOPER as she answers.

LUCY
I’m much better today, thanks.

COOPER notices but doesn’t get involved. Politely, COOPEr simply nods.

COOPER
Good.

COOPER walks to the conference room.




CUT TO:

INT. TWIN PEAKS SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT - DAY

In the conference room, SHERIFF HARRY S. TRUMAN stands beside the table opposite a bird cage. DR. WILL HAYWARD stands at the end of the table bent over an encyclopedia. Near the table hanging from a stand is a bird cage with WALDO, the mynah bird, from JACQUES RENAULT’S cabin. AGENT COOPER walks into the room and stands near the window and the bird cage.

DR. HAYWARD
Alright I found it. Gracula Religiosa. Commonly known as the hill mynah. Native to Southeast Asia-Indonesia. Feeds on fruit mainly. Some invertebrates. Its ability to mimic the human voice is amazing.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yeah well so far we haven’t heard a peep.

SHERIFF TRUMAN walks to the bird cage.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Hey Waldo what’s up.

DR. HAYWARD
Well it says here that mimicry is a kind of play with the mynah. But this one’s in a weakened condition; starved, dehydrated. I’d say he’s feeling anything but playful.

DR. HAYWARD picks up a grape.

DR. HAYWARD
Here ya’ go little fella.

DR. HAYWARD moves to feed the grape to WALDO but sees COOPER staring at the bird.

DR. HAYWARD
Oh, you wanna feed him Agent Cooper?

COOPER
I don’t like birds.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
When do you think he’ll start talking again?

DR. HAYWARD
Well, according to the book his urge to mimic should return with his good health.

COOPER
If it does then we got a witness.

DR. HAYWARD
Well we better keep feeding him.

DR. HAYWARD sourly looks at the grape and then turns to SHERIFF TRUMAN.

DR. HAYWARD
You got any apples?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yeah. There’s some at the bottom of the fridge.

DR. HAYWARD
These grapes are right on the edge.

DEPUTY TOMMY ‘THE HAWK’ HILL enters the room carrying a file.

HAWK
These just came in from your office.

HAWK hands the file to COOPER, who looks it over. COOPER moves over to SHERIFF TRUMAN.

COOPER
Hmm. Forensics confirms that Jacques Renault had three guests to his cabin; Laura Palmer, Ronette Pulaski and Leo Johnson.

COOPER looks at the back of a large photograph. The photograph is marked with a stamp as evidence. COOPER flips the photograph over to look at the image.

COOPER
This is the only exposed negative on that roll of film Harry. Look familiar?

COOPER hands the photo to SHERIFF TRUMAN. SHERIFF TRUMAN scans the photograph and smiles.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
That’s our Waldo.

COOPER
No Harry, the girl. That’s Laura.

SHERIFF TRUMAN gives a puzzled look and looks at the photograph again.


SHERIFF TRUMAN’S POV:

Through SHERIFF TRUMAN’S POV we view a CLOSE-UP of the photograph. The picture is of WALDO perched on the shoulder of a WOMAN with blonde hair.


BACK TO SCENE:

Unsure which end is up, SHERIFF TRUMAN turns the photograph around as he continues to look it over.

COOPER
Well, now we know who and when. We don’t know why.

COOPER stacks some books under the bird cage. COOPER then pulls his mini tape recorder out of his pocket and shows it to SHERIFF TRUMAN.

COOPER
Voice activated Harry.

With a CLICK, COOPER turns the mini recorder on.

COOPER
When the bird talks maybe we’ll get some answers.

MUSIC: FRESHLY SQUEEZED (0:26 - 3:48) (SLOW VARIANT)     77K

COOPER places his mini tape recorder on the stack of books right below the bird cage. COOPER picks up a file from the folder and hands it to SHERIFF TRUMAN. Paper clipped to the file is a plastic bag containing the notched poker chip.

COOPER
Albert confirmed that this matches the fragment found in Laura’s stomach.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Thousand dollar chip from One-Eyed Jacks.

HAWK
Jacques Renault’s working there. Dealing in the casino.

COOPER
Well, I think a little field work is in order.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Jacks is over the border. A little out of our jurisdiction.

COOPER
Well I know that Harry. That’s why I was thinking this would be a good job for the Bookhouse Boys.

SHERIFF TRUMAN understands and smiles.

I called you but your dad answered it. I didn’t know what to say.

BOBBY
Bobby’s here baby, Bobby’s here.

SHELLY uncontrollably starts to cry in fear.

SHELLY
(distraught) I shot him Bobby. I know I did. He just screamed and screamed. He sounded like an animal.

BOBBY
He what? Slow down Shelly. Talk to me.

SHELLY
(distraught) He’s out there ... and now he’s going to kill me. Bobby he’s going to kill me.

BOBBY stands in front and close to SHELLY.

BOBBY
Shelly. Shelly. Start over. Go real slow.

BOBBY cradles his hands around SHELLY’S neck and head.

SHELLY
Leo came home late last night. He was all beat up. He had blood all over him. I told him ... I was never ... ever gonna let him hurt me again but he came at me.

SHELLY becomes even more upset.

SHELLY
So I pulled the trigger. I shot him Bobby. What am I going to do? Where am I going to hide?

BOBBY
Shelly, Leo Johnson is history. Understand?

MUSIC: DARK TIMES???

BOBBY
I’m taking care of you from now on. I’m going to deal with Leo. I’m going to deal with James. Bobby’s going to deal with everything.

SHELLY kisses BOBBY. SHELLY rests her head on BOBBY’S chest. BOBBY cradles SHELLY’S head and gives an intense glare as he thinks.




CUT TO:

EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE - DAY

LEO sits in his truck with his rifle pointed at the house. LEO listens to the police band radio as he waits for BOBBY or SHELLY to exit. Over the police band on the radio, LUCY can be heard.

LUCY (OFF SCREEN)
Birdseed? No this bird eats fruit. The sheriff says its a witness.

Shocked, LEO looks at his radio.

LUCY (OFF SCREEN)
Naw, not just because it saw something, because it talks and it needs to be ...

LEO remembers the bird and immediately reacts. LEO puts his rifle away, closes the door, walks to the other side of the truck, enters and drives off.

MUSIC ENDS: DARK TIMES???




CUT TO:

INT. HAYWARD HOUSE - DAY

We FOCUS on a piano and a black vase. A CLICK from a depressed button is heard followed by the voice of LAURA PALMER from an audio tape. We PAN RIGHT to the dining room table where DONNA HAYWARD and MADELEINE FERGUSON are seated. On the table is a tape player. JAMES HURLEY paces the floor beside the table as he listens.

MUSIC: LAURA PALMER’S THEME    

LAURA (FROM TAPE)
What’s up doc. Just a few words before I go to sleep. I feel like I’m going to dream tonight. Big bad ones, you know, the kind you like. Its easier talking into the recorder. I guess I feel I can say anything. All my secrets. The naked ones. I know you like those doc. I know you like me too. That’ll be my little secret okay. Just like your coconut. Why is it so easy to make men like me? And I don’t even have to try very hard. Maybe ... if it was harder ...

MUSIC ENDS: LAURA PALMER’S THEME    

JAMES stops the tape. MADELEINE picks up an empty cassette case from a shoe box beside her.

MADELEINE
This one’s empty.

MADELEINE hands the empty case to JAMES. JAMES reads the label on the empty case.

JAMES
February 23. The night Laura died.

JAMES hands the empty case back to MADELEINE. DONNA looks in the shoe box for an unboxed tape cassette.

DONNA
The tape’s not in there.

JAMES
He must still have it. I mean she died, he never returned it.

MADELEINE
God, do you think Dr. Jacoby killed her?

JAMES
We’re going to find that tape. Tonight.

DONNA
Where?

JAMES
Jacoby’s office.

MADELEINE
What if he’s there.

JAMES
We’ll get him out.

DONNA
How?

JAMES
Maybe he gets a phone call. From Laura.

JAMES rewinds the tape and then pushes the play button. Again we hear LAURA’S voice from the tape player.

LAURA
What’s up doc?

INT. HORNE’S DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

Standing behind the perfume counter, AUDREY handles a CUSTOMER.

AUDREY
Here try this. It smells like a forest.

AUDREY hands the CUSTOMER a bottle of perfume to smell.

CUSTOMER
This won’t do. I want something more fruity.

AUDREY
Fruity.

CUSTOMER
As in fruit.

MR. EMORY BATTIS, the store vice-president, walks up to the perfume counter and talks to JENNY, a salesgirl working with AUDREY. AUDREY searches for another fragrance for the CUSTOMER but, standing near JENNY, is more interested in listening in on JENNY’S and BATTIS’S discussion.

EMORY
Could I see you in my office in five minutes?

JENNY
Sure.

EMORY walks off.

CUSTOMER
I’m not making myself clear. I want a scent that makes a statement.

AUDREY
Maybe you should try hanging it around your neck. Its a perfume, its a fashion accessory. Two statements for the price of one.

CUSTOMER
I don’t appreciate your attitude.

The CUSTOMER walks away.

AUDREY
(playfully) Well thank you for shopping Horne’s Department Store.

AUDREY walks over to JENNY.

AUDREY
I’m gonna use the little girl’s room.

JENNY
Okay.

AUDREY walks off.




CUT TO:

INT. HORNE’S DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

Outside EMORY’S office, AUDREY tries to sneak inside the empty office but a STOCK BOY is moving boxes on a shelf nearby. In her mischievous way, AUDREY leans against the shelves and tells a lie to rid the STOCK BOY.

AUDREY
You know there’s a real bad accident outside. Sounded like a bus or something.

The STOCK BOY silently heads out to take a look. AUDREY grins and enters EMORY’S office.




CUT TO:

INT. EMORY’S OFFICE - DAY

AUDREY opens a cigarette case, helps herself to one of EMORY’S cigarettes and lights it up. AUDREY opens one of EMORY’S desk drawers but hears EMORY in the hall and calmly moves to a closet, steps inside and closes the door. The closet door has a window shutter-like screen made of thin horizontal wood slats allowing AUDREY to see into the office.

EMORY
Right this way Jen. ... got something really special about ...

AUDREY’S POV:

Through AUDREY’S POV from the closet, EMORY and JENNY enter the office.

EMORY
Come right in. My, my you look lovely. Sit, sit.

JENNY
Thank you Mr. Battis.

MUSIC ENDS: FRESHLY SQUEEZED (0:26- 3:48)

EMORY
This is for you Jenny. A reward for a job well done.

EMORY hands JENNY a small present. JENNY unwraps the present, opens the box and removes the wrapping tissue to reveal a small glass unicorn.

EMORY
Its a unicorn, ancient symbol of purity. Tamed only by the young at heart.

JENNY
Wow, a unicorn.

EMORY
Jenny, you had a good time at the club last week didn’t you?

JENNY
Yeah, yeah I had a great time, Mr. Battis.

EMORY
They were very pleased with you as well, I must say. They’d like you to continue and believe me Jenny not many girls qualify.

JENNY
Really?

EMORY
Yes. Now the variety of work is completely up to you. Hostess, cocktail waitress or, if you are chosen, hospitality girl.

JENNY
What’s that?

MUSIC: FRESHLY SQUEEZED (0:26- 3:48)

EMORY
Hospitality girl’s escort ... important guests, VIP’s. It’s a lucrative opportunity Jenny. Tending to wealthy men in need of a little company.

BACK TO SCENE:

In the closet, AUDREY smiles to herself at hearing EMORY’S definition of the job.


AUDREY’S POV:

JENNY
That sounds cool as long as their wealthy.

EMORY
Jenny, your attitude will take you far in this life.

EMORY hands JENNY a business card.

EMORY
Call this number. Ask for Black Rose. Now why don’t we make a trip to evening wear and find you something elegant.

JENNY
Elegant sounds great Mr. Battis. Elegant.

EMORY escorts JENNY out of the office.


BACK TO SCENE:

AUDREY drops her cigarette to the floor, puts it out by stepping on it, exits the closet and walks over to EMORY’S desk. AUDREY picks up a small black book laying on top of the desk. AUDREY opens the book and flips through the pages. The pages list several different names of women. Beside each name are hearts that rank each girl. On one page AUDREY finds the name of:

AUDREY
Ronette Pulaski.

AUDREY puts the book back. Before she leaves, AUDREY picks up the glass unicorn that JENNY left on the desk.

NORMA JENNINGS steps halfway past the door from the kitchen. NORMA stops as she sees her husband HANK JENNINGS, holding a pot of coffee, talking to SHELLY. A country tune plays on the jukebox.

HANK
When your in prison you remember faces from home. They all seem like friends somehow. Even the ones you barely knew, like something to hang on to I guess.

SHELLY hands a customer their order of a cherry pie.

SHELLY
It must have been hard on you.

HANK
I paid my debt. That’s what counts. You know your a really big help around here and I want to thank you for that. For getting Norma through.

NORMA steps back into the kitchen.

SHELLY
Your welcome Hank.

SHELLY pats HANK’S arm.

SHELLY
No problem.

HANK
She told me in her letters how much you meant and how much Pete helped uh ...

SHELLY fetches a cup of coffee for a customer.

SHELLY
Who?

HANK
Uh ... yeah ... no, not Pete uh ...

SHELLY
Oh you mean Ed.

HANK
Yeah Big Ed.

SHELLY
Yeah.

HANK
Yeah, I’m a little better at faces then names I guess.

The COOK rings the service bell and SHELLY moves off to pick up the order.

HANK
(sinisterly) Yeah, Big Ed.

HANK looks down at the counter where he sees a lighter someone had left behind their plate of food. With his shifty eyes, HANK glances around, casually moves his hand, picks up the lighter and puts it in his back pocket. HANK then moves the dirty plates to a bin.

At the front door, SHERIFF TRUMAN and AGENT COOPER enter the diner. SHERIFF TRUMAN spots HANK.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Hello Hank.

HANK
Hi Harry. Glad to see me?

HANK moves up the island counter towards SHERIFF TRUMAN.

HANK
(jokingly) You uh ... you lookin’ for a free lunch ... I recommend the meatloaf.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Save it. I’m looking for you.

HANK
Harry?

HANK jokingly puts up both of his hands.

HANK
I’m innocent.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What you are is on parole Hank.

SHELLY watches and listens to SHERIFF TRUMAN.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
That means pay your case officer a visit once a week, Fridays. You miss a visit. You go to jail.

MUSIC ENDS: COUNTRY #4

HANK
Thanks for the reminder sheriff. Stop in any time.

HANK stares at SHERIFF TRUMAN and then walks away.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
You think people ever change Cooper? I don’t.

SHELLY walks up to them.

SHELLY
Oh, afternoon guys. Would you like some coffee?

COOPER smiles brightly.

COOPER
Afternoon Shelly, yes.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
We should be on our way.

SHELLY moves to the coffee dispenser. COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN are still standing by the counter as they talk.

COOPER
Harry, I’m going to let you in on a little secret. Everyday, once a day, give yourself a present. Don’t plan it, don’t wait for it, just let it happen.

SHELLY places two cups of coffee on the counter near them.

COOPER
It could be a new shirt at the men store, a catnap in your office chair or ...

COOPER gestures to the cups of coffee on the counter before them.

COOPER
... two cups of good hot black coffee. Like this.

COOPER wears a large grin. SHERIFF TRUMAN grins back.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
A present? Like Christmas?

COOPER nods yes. COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN both move to the counter and take a seat where their coffee has been placed. COOPER grabs his cup and takes a sip. SHERIFF TRUMAN watches COOPER.

COOPER
Ahh man that hits the spot.

SHERIFF TRUMAN grins at COOPER’S reaction. SHERIFF TRUMAN hasn’t touched his cup yet. COOPER slides it over to him.

COOPER
Nothing like a great cup of black coffee.

AUDREY
Ditto. I bet he’s got cartons of them.

JENNY
He probably does.

AUDREY
Jenny I did a real dumb thing um I lost that number that he gave me for Black Rose. Do you have it?

A little unsure, JENNY pauses before she retrieves the card.

JENNY
Yeah, I got it.

AUDREY
Great.

JENNY hands the card to AUDREY, who copies the number down.

AUDREY
Thanks.

JENNY

PETE
I just got that baby back from Tim and Tom’s Taxidermy. When I caught him he was this big. (waves his hand above the side of the fish to show it original thickness) But I guess by the time they take the innards out and put the stuffing in ... it uh ... loses something in the translation.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yeah well Pete it still a fine looking trophy. No matter what the size.

PETE
(chuckle) Well size isn’t everything I guess.

PETE walks away carrying his trophy. JOSIE enters and walks up to SHERIFF TRUMAN.

COOPER
Yeah Harry, what’s on your mind?

COOPER and TRUMAN lean against the bar as they talk.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I’m worried about Josie. She’s been real afraid.

COOPER
About what?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Ben Horne and Catherine Martell. Now they’ve been seeing each other on the side, its been going on for years.

MUSIC: LOVE THEME FROM TWIN PEAKS

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Josie just found out. She thinks their planning to burn down the saw mill and somehow get rid of her too.

COOPER
Do you believe her?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I know Ben Horne wants that land for the Ghostwood development and I know Josie won’t sell. Yeah. Yeah, I believe her.

COOPER
How much do you know about her? Where she’s from, who she was before?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Whatta ya’ getting at?

COOPER
The truth Harry. That’s my job.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
I know all I need to know. I love her and she’s in trouble.

COOPER
That’s good enough for me. Let’s look into it.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Thanks.

TRUMAN pats COOPER’S arm, puts his cup of coffee down and picks up his hat. The two walk away from the bar.

COOPER
Is Hawk ready?

She hangs up the phone.

We see CATHERINE walking with MR. NEV, an insurance salesman, toward the dining room.

MR. NEV
I’m glad you agreed to see me Mrs. Martell.

CATHERINE
That’s quite alright.

MR. NEV
Normally I’d never think to compose this late.

CATHERINE
That’s fine. Now what’s this about?

MR. NEV
Every agent is instructed five signatures. Its really the first thing we learn and ... somehow ... we missed one.

He places his briefcase on the table and opens it.

CATHERINE
Now refresh my memory. What policy is this?

He pulls out an expanding folder from his briefcase and takes out a document.

MR. NEV
Your new life insurance. Since the binder takes effect at midnight tonight I really had no choice. You see, it just couldn’t wait until tomorrow.

He pulls a pen from his shirt pocket, clicks out the pen tip, marks an ‘X’ by the line for her to sign by and hands her the pen.

MR. NEV
Right here please.

CATHERINE takes a seat as she looks over the document.

MR. NEV
Is everything in order Mrs. Martell?

CATHERINE
Yes, it just that ...

CATHERINE
This was handled without our actually meeting each other and I ... I almost forgotten.

MR. NEV
To be perfectly honest with you Mrs. Martell I withheld that last page myself.

CATHERINE
Did you?

MR. NEV
I have to admit I thought it a little ... unusual. Life insurance when the client is too busy ... to be involved. (smiling) I mean, you did know about this policy didn’t you?

CATHERINE
Are you suggesting that there’s something ... irregular at work here?

MR. NEV
I certainly never got that idea from Mrs. Packard, no. Or from Mr. Horne for that matter either. When he offered to collect your signatures I thought it was fine. Just with a new account, I like to be certain to (gestures with the pen as if to cross a ‘T’) cross every ‘T’.

Again he shows her where to sign on the document.

MR. NEV
Right here please.

CATHERINE
You know, I’m noticing that there’s some ... minor changes that I asked my attorney to make that are not included in this draft. I think what I’d like to do is go over this with him on the phone in the morning, and initial the changes and get the completed documents to you at that time.

MR. NEV
If there’s anything that I can do to help you ... with the policy or anything at all?

CATHERINE
(staring at him with a straight face) Are you an ambitious man Mr. Nev.

MR. NEV
One likes to think so.

CATHERINE
One never knows. There may be a few ‘T’s left to cross. Good night.

MR. NEV
Mrs. Martell. (closes his briefcase) I’ll see myself out.

He walks away and out.

CATHERINE
(whispered to herself) Think. Think.

BIG ED
Wow, look at all this.

We PAN to see AGENT COOPER and HAWK. COOPER lets out an ‘ouch’ as HAWK applies tape to a microphone wire on his upper left arm.

HAWK
Sorry.

We ZOOM out to see them all.

COOPER
There’s a curly haired wig in there Ed. It’s gonna work like gangbusters ... and I’ll help you out with one of those moustaches.

BIG ED
Think it’ll fit? I’ve got a big head.

HAWK finishes installing COOPER microphone.

HAWK
Okay, give it a try.

BIG ED moves the curly wig to his head to try it on. COOPER rolls his long sleeve shirt down, lifts his wrist near to his mouth and says ...

COOPER

The speaker from the receiver duplicates what he says but ends with a very loud swoop of distortion from over amplification. COOPER grabs his wrist and all remain silent.

With their guns drawn, SHERIFF TRUMAN and AGENT COOPER meet in the hallway near the door to the conference room. They enter the conference room and lower their guns as they see what was shot, WALDO. DEPUTY HAWK, DEPUTY ANDY, BIG ED and LUCY follow behind them.

BIG ED
What happened?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Somebody shot Waldo. Ah geez.

ANDY
Poor Waldo.

COOPER picks up his mini tape recorder that was set to automatically record on voice activation. He rewinds the tape a bit and plays it. From the tape recorder we hear ...

BIG ED
What happened?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Somebody shot Waldo.

COOPER stops the tape, rewinds it some more and hits play. We hear ...

LUCY
Birdie birdie birdie. Want some orange? Come on lets share.

LUCY, standing by the window with ANDY, looks away slightly embarrassed. Again COOPER stops the tape, rewinds it and hits play. This time we hear ...

COOPER and BIG ED return the stare as she walks by.

Uh-huh. Yeah. So, what’s the catch?

BEN and JERRY are now both spooning out ice cream from the same tub.

JERRY
