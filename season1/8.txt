INT. LOG LADY’S CABIN - DAY

MUSIC: CALL OF THE BLACK LODGE     272K

As she speaks directly to us, the ‘LOG LADY’ MARGARET LANTERMEN holds her wooden log in her arms like a baby. The LOG LADY sits with her back to the fireplace of her cabin and beside a table.

LOG LADY
A drunken man walks in a way that is quite impossible for a sober man to imitate, and vice versa. An evil man has a way, no matter how clever to the trained eye, his way will show itself. Am I being too secretive? No. One can never answer questions at the wrong moment. Life, like music, has a rhythm. This particular song will end with three sharp notes, like deathly drumbeats.

INT. DR. JACOBY’S OFFICE - NIGHT

MUSIC: GENTLE WAVES

We FOCUS on a sandy beach with the a setting sun and hear the gentle WASH of ocean waves. But the waves are not moving. We PAN RIGHT to see that we are looking at a picture covering a wall. We continue to PAN RIGHT and move past the wall to see DONNA HAYWARD and JAMES HURLEY enter the office.

MUSIC: LAURA PALMER’S THEME    

DONNA
Where do we look?

JAMES
I don’t know. Everywhere.

DONNA
Where should we start?

MUSIC ENDS: LAURA PALMER’S THEME    

JAMES moves to a desk, opens a drawer and pulls out a shoe box.

JAMES
Maybe this is something.

JAMES opens the box and finds it loaded with small paper umbrellas used to garnish drinks.

JAMES
Umbrellas?

JAMES picks up one of the tiny umbrellas and looks at a tag that is attached to it. 

JAMES
The Kohalla Hilton, July 1969, men on the moon.

DONNA picks one up and reads its tag.

DONNA
August 9th, 1974. I first lay eyes on Mimsy.

JAMES
Weird.

DONNA
Yeah.

They both snicker. JAMES continues to search the desk. DONNA moves around the room, spots a wall switch and moves to it. DONNA pushes the switch.

MUSIC ENDS: GENTLE WAVES

MUSIC: HAWAIIAN I

The music in the room changes from the sounds of sloshing waves on the beach to a Hawaiian tune. DONNA is startled.

DONNA
James.

JAMES rushes over to DONNA.

JAMES
What you do?

DONNA
I just hit a button.

JAMES
Hit it again.

DONNA pushes the button again.

MUSIC ENDS: HAWAIIAN I

MUSIC: HAWAIIAN II     11K

Another Hawaiian tune starts up. The tune is more upbeat and louder then the previous one. JAMES and DONNA both wander around the room trying to find a control box.

JAMES
There’s gotta be a way to turn it off.

JAMES finds a control box on the shelves near the stereo. He fiddles with several slider controls until the music stops.

MUSIC ENDS: HAWAIIAN II     11K

Near the wall switch, DONNA looks up at a coconut hanging from a small imitation palm tree.

MUSIC: LOVE THEME FROM TWIN PEAKS

DONNA
(whispered to herself) My little coconut.

DONNA removes the coconut from the tree.

DONNA
James.

JAMES walks over to DONNA.

DONNA
Laura said something on her tape about a coconut.

DONNA opens the coconut and they find an audio cassette tape and the missing half-heart gold necklace.

DONNA
Oh my god, the necklace.

SOUND EFFECT: MUSICAL SHRIEK     7K

Still gazing at LAURA/MADELEINE, DR. JACOBY is hit from behind by a MAN dressed in all black including a black ski mask. Caught off guard, DR. JACOBY falls face down onto the ground.

We FOCUS on LAURA/MADELEINE as she hears something and turns to look in the direction from which she heard the sound from.

We FOCUS back on DR. JACOBY. With the sound of a BEATING drum representing a hearbeat, DR. JACOBY’S heart begins to race. The unknown MAN continues to hit DR. JACOBY in the back with his gloved fists. DR. JACOBY lifts his head to look at LAURA/MADELEINE in the distance as he GRUNTS with each hit.

No.

DR. JACOBY moves himself to lay face up.

MATCH DISSOLVE TO: ROULETTE WHEEL

INT. ONE-EYED JACKS - NIGHT

As the last scene, the TIGHT FOCUS on DR. JACOBY’S left eye, FADES OUT we FADE IN to FOCUS on a top view of a spinning roulette wheel. A white marble is dropped in and bounces around for a while until it stops in a marked crevice.

DEALER (OFF SCREEN)
Red 36.

BACK TO SCENE:

Beside the roulette table stands ‘BIG’ ED HURLEY dressed in his undercover garb of a western outfit, wig and moustache. Standing next to him is one the establishments 52‘ PICK-UPS, a hospitality girl.

52 PICK-UP #1
Sorry Mister, I guess our date’s off.

BIG ED shrugs and walks away from the roulette table. People can be heard placing bets and laughing. BIG ED passes FBI SPECIAL AGENT DALE COOPER as he walks through the casino. AGENT COOPER is seated at a Black Jack table. JACQUES RENAULT is the dealer. We FOCUS on COOPER and JACQUES as BIG ED walks off. JACQUES speaks with a slight French-Canadian accent.

JACQUES
Sir are you absolutely sure you want another card?

COOPER
Yes please.

JACQUES pulls another card from the deck and places it face up, the deuce of hearts. COOPER flips over his one card laying face down to reveal that he has ...

COOPER
Twenty-one. Can you beat that?

JACQUES turns his one card laying face down to reveal a pair of kings for 20. COOPER wins the hand.

COOPER
Mother always said I was born lucky.

JACQUES shuffles the deck as a 52’ PICK-UP #2, walks up to COOPER, cups her hand around his ear and whispers something. COOPER reaches up and places a poker chip in her hand.

COOPER
Maybe later. Thanks for asking.

She purses her lips and walks off. JACQUES grins and moves his eyebrows up and down with a gesture to the woman.

COOPER
This is for you.

COOPER slides a poker chip on the table towards JACQUES. The poker chip is a thousand dollar chip with a notch in it, the chip from his cabin. JACQUES looks it over and his eyes brighten.

COOPER
I’m a friend of Leo’s.

JACQUES
Who’s Leo?

COOPER
Buy you a cocktail Jacques?



CUT TO:

INT. BLACKIE’S OFFICE - NIGHT


INSERT: CLOSE-UP VIDEO MONITOR

On a black and white monitor we see AGENT COOPER, in his tuxedo, seated at a Black Jack table.


BACK TO SCENE:

Two video surveillance monitors sit side-by-side on the corner of a BLACKIE’S desk. One of the monitors is trained on COOPER at a Black Jack table.

Seated at her office desk, BLACKIE ‘THE BLACK ROSE’ O’REILLY is playing a hand of solitaire.

BLACKIE’S office door opens and two of the establishment ‘52’ PICK-UPS’ enter and take positions beside the door as they escort AUDREY HORNE inside.

BLACKIE
Come in.

AUDREY walks inside wearing white lingerie decorated with little red print bows, white stockings and supporters, white shoes and a small, lacy coat.

BLACKIE
Turn around.

AUDREY complies and turns around.

BLACKIE
Yes. Very nice. Come over here.

AUDREY
Who’s that?

BLACKIE
No names child. You don’t offer and you don’t ask.

AUDREY bows her head.

AUDREY
Yes ma’am.

BLACKIE sweeps open a deck of cards face up on her desk.

BLACKIE
Pick a card.

AUDREY picks a card by slowly nudging the surrounding cards away from one card and then nudging the surrounding cards on the other side.

MUSIC: HAPPY THOUGHTS     18K

The card is the queen of diamonds. AUDREY puts her finger on the card. BLACKIE looks up, smiles and puts her own hand over AUDREY’S.

CUT TO:

INT. POLICE VAN - NIGHT

Listening in on the conversation from the microphone planted on AGENT COOPER, we see DEPUTY TOMMY ‘THE HAWK’ HILL wearing headphones and seated around recording equipment. BIG ED is seated beside him in the van. We can hear the conversation between COOPER and JACQUES from the recording equipment.

COOPER (OFF SCREEN)
Jacques, how long have you been dealing Black Jack?

JACQUES (OFF SCREEN)
Long enough to spot a card counter.

COOPER (OFF SCREEN)
Do you always let card counters buy you a drink?

JACQUES (OFF SCREEN)
I don’t see tips like that every day.



CUT TO:

INT. ONE-EYED JACKS - NIGHT

Seated at a small table in a corner of the casino, we see AGENT COOPER talking to JACQUES.

COOPER
Leo ever mention me to you?

Before he answers, JACQUES stares at a WAITRESS as she bends down towards them and then walks away.

JACQUES
I don’t know Mister. Who are you?

COOPER
I can’t believe Leo never told you about me.

JACQUES
Or maybe he did. I don’t know.

COOPER
Leo played you like a violin. Had you and your brother taking all the risk running the product across the border. Never cut you in on a piece of the action.

JACQUES
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

COOPER
Take that chip out of your pocket and take a look at it. Go ahead. That chip is a special significance. A very special night you spent up at your cabin. Here’s a clue.

COOPER mimics WALDO the mynah bird.

COOPER
Laura, Laura.

JACQUES remembers and quickly tries to leaves his seat. Being calm, COOPER holds JACQUES’S arm down to keep him from scampering away.

COOPER
Take it easy, take it easy. How do you think a low rent hump like Leo’s been financing this little operation.

JACQUES
You?

COOPER
I’m the bank.

JACQUES
He never mentioned your name.

COOPER
Of course not. Leo makes the buy with my cash. You and your brother mule it across theborder. Did he ever tell you who was distributing state-side?

JACQUES
Naw. Some high school kid. That’s all I know.

COOPER
That’s right. We’re in sync now Jacques can you feel it? Can you?

JACQUES grins.

JACQUES
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

COOPER
Good. Cause I got a job for you across the border tonight. No Leo. No middle man.

COOPER reaches into his pocket and pulls out a fold of cash.

COOPER
Its ten grand. Half now, half on completion. How’s that sound?

JACQUES snatches the wad of cash from COOPER’S hand.

JACQUES
Sounds good. What are we doing?

COOPER
You meet me at the water processing plant on Black Lake in two hours. Is that going to be a problem?

JACQUES
No, no problem.

COOPER
Good.

JACQUES downs the rest of his beer.

COOPER
One more question Jacques. You know, Leo told me all about that night up at the cabin with the girls. I’m curious about the chip. How’d that happen?

MUSIC: LOVE THEME FROM TWIN PEAKS

JACQUES LAUGHS slightly.

JACQUES
It was that crazy bird.

COOPER
Bird?

JACQUES
It had a thing for Laura. Saying her name all the time like he’s in love or something. So we’re all partying, girls are all getting pretty high, everybody’s pretty crazy.

COOPER
You, Laura and Ronette.

JACQUES
Leo lets Waldo out of the cage and the bird, he lands on her shoulder.

JACQUES LAUGHS.

JACQUES
Laura, she’s all tied up. Oh, she liked that. The bird, he starts pecking on her shoulder. Pecking like love pecks or something, ...

JACQUES LAUGHS again.

JACQUES
... you know what I mean. So Leo, he’s doing a number on her and Laura she’s screaming about that damn bird.

CLOSE ON: JACQUES MOUTH

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of JACQUES mouth as he speaks. The scene is SLOW-DOWNED.

JACQUES
So Leo takes out a chip puts it in her mouth and says bite the bullet baby, bite the bullet.

JACQUES LAUGHS.


BACK TO SCENE:

COOPER
Thanks for clearing that up.

JACQUES
Yeah, no problem.

MUSIC ENDS: LOVE THEME FROM TWIN PEAKS

COOPER
See you on the other side.

JACQUES stands up.

JACQUES
Can do cabby.

JACQUES leaves. COOPER raises his wrist to his mouth, where the microphone is located.

COOPER
Got a trout on the line Hawk. This one’s a keeper.

A WOMAN, 52’ PICK-UP #3, LAUGHS.

52’ PICK-UP #3 (OFF SCREEN)

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. JOHNSON HOUSE - NIGHT

As the last scene FADES OUT we FADE IN on the next scene. In the kitchen, SHELLY JOHNSON picks up a bottle of shampoo from the table and places it by the sink. SHELLY places a folded yellow bath towel near the sink and a handgun beside it. At the kitchen sink, SHELLY begins to wash her hair.

MUSIC: LAURA PALMER’S THEME    

SHELLY has worked up a thick lather in her hair but as she works it in her hair she rubs some of the soap into her right eye. The soap stings. SHELLY can’t wipe her eyes with her hands covered in soapy lather. Blindly, SHELLY reaches to the side for the bath towel.

MUSIC ENDS: LAURA PALMER’S THEME    


CLOSE ON: COUNTERTOP

We FOCUS on a CLOSE-UP of the countertop where the towel lays as SHELLY reaches over to grab it but the towel is slowly being pulled away from her reach. SHELLY is being drawn away from the handgun. SHELLY doesn't realize what is happening until it is too late as she scrambles for the gun but her hand is grabbed and pulled away.


BACK TO SCENE:

LEO JOHNSON moves behind SHELLY and puts his other hand over her mouth. SHELLY can’t yell or escape. SHELLY cries into his hands as LEO yells.

INT. SHERIFF TRUMAN’S POLICE CRUISER - NIGHT

From a viewpoint in the back seat, SHERIFF TRUMAN and DEPUTY ANDY talk as they wait for JACQUES to fall into their trap. Through the front window, the factory surroundings are dark.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Is Lucy talking to you yet?

ANDY
As we say in the law enforcement game, its a cold trail.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Ahhhhhh women.

Over the police radio we hear DEPUTY HAWK.

HAWK (OFF SCREEN)
Harry, Hawk here. The trout’s heading upstream towards the net.

SHERIFF TRUMAN picks up the microphone to reply.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Hawk, ...

INSERT: BLACK LAKE WATER PROCESSING PLANT

We view the mechanical surroundings of the water processing plant as we listen to TRUMAN and HAWK.

SHERIFF TRUMAN (OFF SCREEN)
... hold the line. We’ll set the hook. You gotta 20 on Agent Cooper?

In the distance, a car drives up.

HAWK (OFF SCREEN)
He’s down stream about ten minutes. He’ll probably miss the catch but he’ll be there when we grill him.


BACK TO SCENE:

Directly ahead, the car comes to a stop and parks.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Copy that. We’ll make our move as soon as the big fish shows his fins.

JACQUES RENAULT steps out of the car.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Ready Andy?

ANDY
Ready Harry.

DISTANT VIEW POINT:

From a distance, TRUMAN’S police cruiser starts up and its police lights and siren turn on as it quickly accelerates. Another police cruiser, a backup unit, follows right behind them.


BIRD’S EVE VIEW:

We now get an OVERHEAD view as TRUMAN’S cruiser and the backup unit race toward JACQUES’S car. A third police cruiser, manned by DEPUTY FRED and DEPUTY #1, are also driving toward JACQUES’S car but opposite TRUMAN’S cruiser. Together they box JACQUES’S car in.


BACK TO SCENE:

Completely off guard, JACQUES spins around and attempts getting into his car but SHERIFF TRUMAN slams his brakes, jumps out of his cruiser, points his gun and yells.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
JACQUES! KEEP YOUR HANDS WHERE I CAN SEE ’EM! PUT ’EM ON THE ROOF OF THE CAR NOW!

FRED
YOU HEARD HIM!

DEPUTY #1
Cuff him!

DEPUTY FRED moves behind JACQUES to cuff him. SHERIFF TRUMAN puts his gun in its holster.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
You’re under arrest ... for the attempted murder of Ronette Pulaski and the murder of Laura Palmer.

SHERIFF TRUMAN turns away from JACQUES and heads toward his police cruiser. DEPUTY FRED struggles with JACQUES to cuff his hands together.

FRED
Give me the other hand. Give me your other hand!

JACQUES throws his right elbow into FRED’s gut. JACQUES frees himself of FRED’s grip and reaches for the gun on FRED’s belt as he bends forward in pain. JACQUES grabs the gun, grips it with both hands and aims it toward SHERIFF TRUMAN.

FRED
HE’S GOT MY GUN!

DEPUTY #1
HARRY LOOK OUT!

SHERIFF TRUMAN spins around. A shot RINGS out. JACQUES RENAULT gets hit in the shoulder and falls to the ground. SHERIFF TRUMAN is stunned as he sees JACQUES fall. TRUMAN turns his head and sees ANDY forcibly poised as he points his gun toward JACQUES. DEPUTY HAWK and BIG ED have just arrived in the white van. HAWK rushes over to JACQUES.

JACQUES (OFF SCREEN)
My shoulder.

Stunned, TRUMAN stands blank faced.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Andy?

HAWK (OFF SCREEN)
Better call an ambulance.

ANDY
Are you okay Harry?

SHERIFF TRUMAN
(stunned) Yeah.

In the background, DEPUTY HAWK stands next to JACQUES. BIG ED helps DEPUTY FRED.

HAWK
Shut up. You’re all right.

ANDY
Better call that ambulance.

HAWK
You have the right to remain silent.

Staring at ANDY, SHERIFF TRUMAN is still stunned.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
Yeah.

HAWK (OFF SCREEN)
Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney.

LAURA (FROM TAPE)
Hey, what’s up, doc? Its Laura in case you haven’t guessed. It’s Thursday the twenty-third, and I’m so bored. Actually, I’m in kind’a of a weird mood. (slight cry in her voice) God, James is sweet ... but he’s so dumb ... and right now I can only take so much of sweet. Hey, remember that mystery man I told you about. Well, if I tell you his name then you’re gonna be in trouble. He wouldn’t be such a mystery man any more but you might be history man. I think, a couple of times, he’s tried to kill me.

As the last scene FADES OUT we FADE IN to the next scene. An establish shot. We view the front of the house. Crickets can be heard CHIRPING and a fog horn BLOWS in the distance.




CUT TO:

INT. BLUE PINE LODGE - NIGHT

We FOCUS on the reflection of a suitcase full of cash. A wrapped bundle of bills is thrown into the case. We ZOOM out to see HANK JENNINGS close the suitcase. We ZOOM out further to see JOSIE PACKARD leaning against the cabinet beside HANK.

HANK
Its all here. You’re very generous Josie. Sitting in that concrete box all that time, ninety grand seemed like all the money in creation. Kept me going. Its ... funniest thing, back in the world, I don’t know, ...

HANK lifts and bobs the suitcase up and down.

HANK
... it seems kinda’ light.

JOSIE
We had an agreement.

JOSIE walks away from HANK and over to the kitchen counter. JOSIE lights up a cigarette. HANK follows JOSIE to the counter.

HANK
Oh I’ve been going over this in my mind and ... see if you can follow my thinking. We’re all born into life and we have a certain number of years to move and breathe and have our vein. That’s from a book on oriental philosophy I read when I was in the joint. And maybe somebody, somewhere, knows how much time we have. I don’t, do you?

JOSIE blows her cigarette smoke into HANK’S face. HANK belligerently breathes it in deeply.

HANK
So, when a man gives up a certain portion of his life, eighteen months for instance. How does he place a value on that time? Eighteen months, ninety thousand, what’s that? Uh, five thousand a month. Well that’s not bad if you’re going to live another forty or fifty years but what if you only got another twenty or ten ... or some unforeseen event kills you tomorrow. As in the case of the boating accident that killed your late husband Andrew.

JOSIE moves into the living room. HANK follows her. In the background, behind HANK, is a deer head trophy. The horns of the trophy align with HANK’S head making it appear that the horns are sprouting from his head.

HANK
Or say, you just got out of prison. Where you went in for vehicular manslaughter as part of an agreement to avoid being implicated in the commission of a much greater crime, murder. For which in fact you were responsible. But now there’s this threat, this possible threat, that ... this fact could be discovered ... and in one stroke, ten or fifteen or twenty more years of your life could be cut right off from underneath you. So I’ve been asking myself. What does that do to the market value of eighteen months?

JOSIE turns around to face HANK.

JOSIE
We had an agreement.

She walks back to the kitchen counter. Again, HANK follows her.

MUSIC: HANK’S THEME     39K

HANK
And we still do sweetheart. Signed, sealed, delivered ... and I want to take care of everything we agreed to. You see, you want a lot for your money ... and I want a lot for my time. You know there’s a saying in the joint. Its not oriental philosophy but it has a similar kind of logic that appeals to my uh ...

JOSIE tries to walk away from him but HANK grabs her arms and turns her around to face him.

HANK
... spiritual nature.

HANK grabs JOSIE’S right hand and clasps her fingers with the fingers on his right hand with their thumbs sticking up.

HANK
Once you’re in business with somebody you’re in business for life, like a marriage.

Using his left hand, HANK pulls out a switch blade knife and clicks it open with a push of a button. HANK moves the blade to JOSIE’S thumb and gently slashes it. JOSIE writhes slightly in pain as blood oozes out of the cut. Next, HANK slashes his own thumb. HANK then presses his bleeding thumb against JOSIE’S.

HANK
Partner.

HANK releases his grip, moves his cut thumb to his mouth and licks the blood off with a smack. JOSIE trembles in fear. HANK walks off and leaves. JOSIE, still trembling, moves her thumb to her mouth and wipes the blood on her red lips.

INT. PACKARD SAW MILL - NIGHT

In the accounting office, CATHERINE MARTELL frantically throws and slams files out of a filing cabinet. From the open door of the office, two MILL WORKERS watch CATHERINE as she tosses the files around. PETE MARTELL walks up to the open office door to see what the commotion is all about. PETE throws a questioning glance to one of MILL WORKERS.

CATHERINE
Damn. Where? Where is it?

PETE steps into the office.

PETE
Catherine?

Holding files, CATHERINE turns to face PETE.

CATHERINE
The account ledger, have you seen it?

PETE closes the door behind himself.

PETE
Well don’t you keep it in that little safe at home?

CATHERINE
No, its not in the safe at home. Its not here. Its not anywhere. Tell me you didn’t take it?

PETE shrugs.

PETE
I didn’t take it.

CATHERINE
Pete, tell me the truth. You’re not helping her to pull something here.

PETE notices that the two MILL WORKERS are still watching them. PETE moves to close the horizontal blind to the window they are using to peer inside.

PETE
Who?

CATHERINE
Josie.

PETE
Oh no.

PETE moves to close another horizontal blind to a window that the two nosy MILL WORKERS have moved to.

PETE
Pull what here?

CATHERINE
Oh Peter. Forget everything that we’ve ever said or done to hurt each other.

PETE
Just like that.

PETE closes another horizontal blind.

CATHERINE
Temporarily. I know our marriage is a living train wreck but there used to be something caring between us. The fella who caught my eye. The lumber jack that ... could scamper up a tree like a ... cat.

PETE becomes tearyed eyed.

PETE
The boss’s sister from that big house on the hill.

CATHERINE
A summer’s indiscretion and here we are.

PETE
(slightly embarrassed) Catherine.

MUSIC: TWIN PEAKS THEME    

CATHERINE
Oh Peter. I never should have taken you to that house on the hill.

PETE
Oh I have no complaints about the house.

CATHERINE
As for me taking my principle pleasure in lashing out at the one person who was decent enough to stand by me through all my foolishness.

PETE
I know things haven’t been easy for ya’.

CATHERINE
Peter, somewhere under all that scar tissue there’s the faintest flicker of what we used to feel for each other. I’m asking you to feel that now.

PETE
Why? Exactly.

CATHERINE
(emotional) Because I’m in trouble ... and given what I’ve become and the way I’ve treated people there’s no one else I can turn to. I need your help.

PETE listens on with tears in his eyes. PETE rushes over to CATHERINE and gives her a big hug.

PETE
Oh Catherine. Catherine.

CATHERINE rolls her eyes and gently pats his back.

INT. TWIN PEAKS SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

Standing by the reception office, BIG ED retells the previous night’s events to two DEPUTIES plus DEPUTY FRED, DEPUTY ANDY and DEPUTY HAWK. 

BIG ED
So, Fred starts to put the cuffs on him right. Now Harry, he turns to go. Now all of a sudden Jacques throws an elbow at Fred like this.

BIG ED visually shows the group the move JACQUES made.

BIG ED
Wham!

LUCY, with her back to group, is listening as she waters some plants in the reception area.

HAWK
And in one move he takes Fred’s gun and he’s got the drop on Harry.

BIG ED
Harry is deader then a pound of road side stew.

HAWK
Then, all of a sudden, a single shot rings out.

ANDY puts his hands to together with his index fingers pointed out to resemble a gun and reenacts his shooting of JACQUES. ANDY includes the sound effect of the gun firing, ‘Paa-kehhh’. BIG ED, DEPUTY HAWK and the surrounding DEPUTIES clap and cheer him on.

HAWK
All right! Andy the man.

LUCY turns to look at ANDY. Their eyes meet. LUCY smiles, shyly turns away and quickly scampers into the coffee station.

BIG ED
Alright Andy.

HAWK pushes ANDY to talk to LUCY.

HAWK
Go ahead Andy. Give it your best shot. Go on.

ANDY tugs his belt up and walks to the coffee station. LUCY turns her head to look at ANDY and quickly turns her head away. ANDY turns around and closes the accordion doors of the coffee station for privacy. ANDY turns to LUCY, grabs her by the arms and turns her around to face him. Slowly, they move to kiss. ANDY and LUCY both puts their arms around each other as they longingly kiss each other. Still holding each other, LUCY and ANDY separate from the kiss to look at each other.

LUCY
Oh Andy.

ANDY
Oh Punky.

LUCY
I’m pregnant.

ANDY’S eyes widen. He remains silent. LUCY becomes irritated by his silence and expression. ANDY opens the doors to the coffee station, slowly walks out and moves down the hall. BIG ED and HAWK watch ANDY silently walk off.

HAWK
Uh-oh.

Carrying a watering pitcher, LUCY exits the coffee station and walks by HAWK and BIG ED. Angry, LUCY stares at HAWK and BIG ED and barks.

LUCY
Fresh ... coffee.

LUCY walks to her office. BIG ED and HAWK shake their heads and walk away. We PAN to see the other DEPUTIES also walk off. We ZOOM in on the reception window to LUCY’S office. In her office, LUCY’S telephone RINGS. Annoyed, LUCY rudely answers it.

JACQUES
Yeah, they’ve both been up there before.

JACQUES cracks a slight joke.

JACQUES
They was no nuns.

COOPER
Is that where you took the pictures for Fleshworld?

JACQUES
Yeah, that was Laura’s idea. She talked Ronette into uhm making them ads.

COOPER

SHERIFF TRUMAN

JACQUES
I don’t know why. That’s why we fought.

JACQUES CHUCKLES slightly.

JACQUES
I’m bleeding like this ... stuffed pig and he’s laughing.

COOPER
So you used Leo’s shirt to stop the bleeding. What then?

JACQUES
I got sick. I go outside, pass out. I wake up, I’m lying on the ground.

COOPER
Where was Leo?

JACQUES
Leo, the girls, they gooonnnne.

JACQUES LAUGHS.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
What about the train car?

Surprised by the question, COOPER looks at TRUMAN.

JACQUES
Uhm I don’t know nothing about that. I come down the hill. Leo’s car is gone. Had to walk fifteen miles back down to my own house.

JACQUES LAUGHS slightly before his eyes begin to close as the pain killers take effect.

In the same room with JACQUES, AGENT COOPER and SHERIFF TRUMAN walk across to DR. JACOBY’S bed. They stop short of the bed as they huddle to talk.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
So Leo had to take the girls to the train car by himself. Do you believe him?

COOPER
He’s too stupid to lie.

SHERIFF TRUMAN
He’ll testify against Leo. We got him.

COOPER
We got to find Leo first.

DR. HAYWARD walks away from DR. JACOBY’S bed and up to COOPER and TRUMAN.

COOPER
Doc, how’s Jacoby?

DR. HAYWARD
He’s out of the woods. Listen he uh ... he says he got a phone call from Laura Palmer. He was on his way to see her when he was jumped. That brought on the heart attack.

COOPER
Any description of the assailant?

DR. HAYWARD
He didn’t see him but he says he saw Laura Palmer standing by the gazebo in Easter Park.

Puzzled, COOPER and TRUMAN look at each other.

HANK

KANK uses his fingers to show about a one-inch thickness.

HANK
... yea thick, you know, and you lie there at night thinking. If this mattress is so skinny, how they’d get all those rocks inside?

HANK and NORMA LAUGH slightly.

HANK
So uh, you forgive me if I tell ya’ that uh ... night after night I dream of you lying there on that big feather bed.

NORMA looks away from HANK.

HANK
Oh, I guess the uh ... hired help shouldn’t be so familiar with the boss lady, huh.

NORMA
I can’t blame you for dreaming.

HANK
I wasn’t just dreaming about being with you Norma. What I was trying ... I shouldn’t even be saying this much. Heck.

HANK throws his towel to the countertop.

NORMA
I think you should.

HANK
Naw, I haven’t earned the right Norma. I’ve been back what, two days.

NORMA
Say what you want to say.

HANK
I’ve been trying to picture a whole life with you. With the diner. Making it soar. Making it blue sky.

NORMA turns away from him again.

HANK
I always talk too big. That’s one of my biggest faults. I learned that talking to my counselor inside. This is new territory for me. But I’m going to try Norma. You know, its twenty years we’ve been together next month. Can you believe it? Maybe we’re doing this all backwards. Maybe its the next twenty that counts.

To Ghostwood Estates and Country Club.

BENJAMIN pulls a cigar out of his pocket and bites the tip off. BEN walks over to BLACKIE, who was standing off to the side.

BLACKIE
Congratulations boss.

BLACKIE lights BEN’S cigar. Standing beside her, BEN holds BLACKIE close.

BENJAMIN
Blackie old pal, this calls for a celebration. Let’s have a look ... at the new girl.



CUT TO:

INT. ONE-EYED JACKS - NIGHT

We FOCUS on a large card of the queen of diamonds. We ZOOM out to see an OLD LADY, with a hunched back, sewing the card to the front of AUDREY’S lingerie. There is a KNOCK at the door. The OLD LADY scampers away.

OLD LADY
Good luck honey.

The OLD LADY exits the room through a hidden door.

BENJAMIN
Close your eyes.

AUDREY’S POV:

Through AUDREY’S POV we FOCUS on the reflection from a mirror of BENJAMIN as he enters the room and closes the door behind himself.


BACK TO SCENE:

AUDREY, still seated, is stunned.


AUDREY’S POV:

Through AUDREY’S POV we FOCUS on the reflection from a mirror of BENJAMIN near the door to the room behind a deep reveal.

BENJAMIN
This is such stuff that dreams are made of.

Still viewing his reflection in the mirror, BEN slowly walks into the room.




DISSOLVE TO:

INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - NIGHT

As the last scene FADES OUT the next scene FADES IN. In a hallway of the hotel, AGENT DALE COOPER walk up the hall toward his room. With his tie undone, AGENT COOPER is carrying his tuxedo jacket in his left hand over his shoulder. In his right hand COOPER carries his mini tape recorder which he is talking into.

COOPER
Diane, 4:37 am. After a long investigative night, returning to my room at the Great Northern. We have one suspect in custody and Leo Johnson, the man I believe was responsible for Laura’s death, won’t be able to escape the drag net we’ve thrown up for him much longer.

AGENT COOPER pauses to listen and looks around.

COOPER
As you can hear from the ambient sound around me ... and I notice with some relief, that the Icelandic group staying on my floor have either checked or passed out. I may not need the Ear Pillow ear plugs. Which I did receive today Diane. Although I suspect I may put them to use as a purely precautionary measure. I ordered some hot milk from room service. Here’s hoping that does the job and I’ll be able to catch a few hours of quality sack time. Twenty-four hour room service must be one of the premiere achievements of modern civilization.

COOPER turns off his mini tape recorder, unlocks the door to his room, opens it and enters.




CUT TO:

INT. DALE COOPER’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Upon entering his hotel room COOPER spots a small envelope on the floor. COOPER picks up the envelope. COOPER smiles as he reads aloud who the envelope is addressed to.

COOPER
My special agent.

The telephone RINGS. COOPER walks across the room to answer it.

COOPER
Cooper here. (reply) Who is this? (reply) Could this wait till tomorrow morning?

There is a KNOCK at the door.

COOPER
Please excuse me I got room service.

COOPER places the receiver beside the phone as he moves to answer the door. ANDY can be heard from the phone.

ANDY (OFF SCREEN)
(static) We found him. (clear) Its Andy, Deputy Andy. Agent Cooper? We found Leo Johnson. He’s been shot. Agent Cooper?

COOPER opens the door.


COOPER’S POV:

Through COOPER’S POV the first thing he sees is a gun that DISCHARGES before he can do anything.


BACK TO SCENE:

The gun is FIRED again and we see that the two shots have hit AGENT COOPER in the chest. The gun DISCHARGES one more time.

FADE OUT:




AGENT COOPER can be heard falling to the ground with a THUD.
